    "description": "arly modern scholars often use the term \u2018\u2018romance\u2019\u2019 in speaking about Renaissance literature. Loose and ill-defined as it is, \u2018\u2018romance\u2019\u2019 still seems the best fit for all those curious older form of fictions we cannot quite call \u2018\u2018novels,\u2019\u2019 distant as they are from the conventions of modern realism. Today we use \u2018\u2018romance\u2019\u2019 quite broadly: we speak of chivalric romances such as Ariosto\u2019s Orlando furioso (1516, 1532), pastoral romances such as Sannazaro\u2019s Arcadia (1504), or Greek romances like the Aethiopica of Helio- dorus (third or fourth century CE), for example. \u2018\u2018Romance\u2019\u2019 has become the word that indicates one of our most powerful genre categories, inspir- ing a long tradition of theory from W. P. Ker, Erich Auerbach, Northrop Frye, Patricia Parker, David Quint, and many others.1 But for sixteenth- century readers, the term as we understand it now did not exist. Much of what we today call Renaissance \u2018\u2018romance\u2019\u2019 was, in its own day, a genre with- out a name\u2014if, in fact, the authors of the new modes of fiction believed they worked within a common genre at all",
