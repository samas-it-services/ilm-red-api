Without a sound, the robber sank to the earth, whereupon the citizen, whether he had lost his head through fear, or thought Mr. Middleton a new and more dangerous outlaw, fled away like the wind. Snatching the bag of valuables in the unconscious thief’s hands, Mr. Middleton made toward the other robber, who, to his astonishment, hissed without looking around: “What did you let your man get away for, you fool? Try and make yourself useful somehow. Hold this swag and cover the man, so I can have both hands and get through quick.” Taking the valuables the robber handed him, Mr. Middleton with calmness and deliberation placed them in his pockets, after which he placed a muzzle of a pistol in the back of the robber’s neck and sharply commanded: “Hands up!” Up went the robber’s hands as if he were a jumping-jack jerked by a string, whereupon his late victim, doubtless animated by the same emotions as those of the other citizens, fled away like the wind, but not in silence, for at every jump he bellowed, “Thieves, murder, help!” A window slammed up in the house before which they were standing and the glare of an electric bicycle lamp played full upon Mr. Middleton and his prisoner. “I’ve got him,” said Mr. Middleton, proudly. “Got him! Got him!” gasped an astonished voice. “Well, of all effrontery! Got him, you miserable thief? The police are coming and they’ll get you, and I can identify you, if they don’t succeed in nabbing you red-handed.” Shocked and almost paralyzed, Mr. Middleton turned to expostulate with the misled householder, when the robber, seizing the opportunity, fled away like the wind, bellowing at every jump, “Thieves, murder, help!” and as if aroused by the sound of his compatriot’s voice, the thief who had been lying unconscious in the street all this while, arose and hastened away, somewhat unsteadily, it is true, yet at a considerable degree of speed. It did not require any extended reflective processes for Mr. Middleton to tell himself that if he waited for the police, he would be in a very bad plight, for he had the stolen property upon his person, the thieves had gone, and even if the victims were able to say he was not one of the two original thieves—which their disturbed state of mind made most uncertain—they would be likely to declare him a thief notwithstanding, a charge which the stolen property on his person would bear out. The police could now be heard down the street and the householder was making the welkin ring with vociferous shouts. With a sudden access of rage at this individual whose well-intended efforts had thwarted justice and might yet fasten crime upon innocence, Mr. Middleton pointed a pistol at the upper pane of the window where shone the bicycle lamp. There was a roar that shook the air, followed by a crash of glass and the clatter of a dozen bullets upon the brick wall of the house, and a shriek of terror from the householder and the bicycle lamp instantly vanished. With a heart strangely at peace in the midst of the dangers that encompassed him, Mr. Middleton sped up the street, dashed through an alleyway, back for a block on the next street in the direction he had just come, and thenceforth leisurely and with an appearance of virtue he did not need to feign, made his way home without molestation. Upon examining the booty that had so strangely come into his possession, Mr. Middleton was at a loss to think which were the greater villains, those who had robbed, or those who had been robbed. One wallet contained five hundred and forty dollars in greenbacks and some memoranda accompanying it showed that it was a corruption fund to be used in bribing voters at an approaching election. The other wallet contained sixty dollars and a detailed plan for bribery, fraud, and intimidation which was to be carried out in one of the doubtful wards. There were also some silver coins, and two gold watches bearing no names or marks that could identify their owners, but the detailed plan contained the name of the politician who had drawn it up and who was to be benefited by its successful accomplishment. This was a clue by following which Mr. Middleton might have found the parties who had been robbed and return their property, but he was deterred from doing so by several considerations.","page_number":72,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 774, \"characters\": 4431}","created_at":"2025-08-19 14:45:58.308505+00"},{"id":"000e57c4-a347-4387-93cd-5397fda11474","book_id":"a4339969-d653-4e01-9416-be1d71482941","chunk_index":83,"content":"It is a story with red blood in it.

It is inclosed in a thin membrane, which separates it from the surrounding white. The yolk, being lighter than the white, floats to that portion of the egg which is uppermost, but is held in position by two membranous cords, one from each end of the egg. The average weight of an egg is about two ounces, of which ten per cent consists of shell, sixty of white, and thirty of yolk. How to Choose Eggs. —The quality of eggs varies considerably, according to the food upon which the fowls are fed. Certain foods communicate distinct flavors, and it is quite probable that eggs may be rendered unwholesome through the use of filthy or improper food; hence it is always best, when practicable, to ascertain respecting the diet and care of the fowls before purchasing eggs. On no account select eggs about the freshness of which there is any reason to doubt. The use of stale eggs may result in serious disturbances of the digestive organs. An English gentleman who has investigated the subject quite thoroughly, finds upon careful microscopical examination that stale eggs often contain cells of a peculiar fungoid growth, which seems to have developed from that portion of the egg which would have furnished material for the flesh and bones of the chick had the process of development been continued. Experiments with such eggs upon dogs produce poisonous effects. There are several ways of determining with tolerable accuracy respecting the freshness of an egg. A common test is to place it between the eye and a strong light. If fresh, the white will appear translucent, and the outline of the yolk can be distinctly traced. By keeping, eggs become cloudy, and when decidedly stale, a distinct, dark, cloud-like appearance may be discerned opposite some portion of the shell. Another test is to shake the egg gently at the ear; if a gurgle or thud is heard, the egg is bad. Again, eggs may be tested by dropping into a vessel containing a solution of salt and water, in the proportion of a tablespoonful to a quart. Newly laid eggs will sink; if more than six days old, they will float in the liquid; if bad, they will be so light as to ride on the surface of the brine. The shell of a freshly laid egg is almost full; but owing to the porous character of the shell, with age and exposure to air a portion of the liquid substance of which the egg is composed evaporates, and air accumulates in its place at one of the extremities of the shell. Hence an egg loses in density from day to day, and the longer the egg has been kept, the lighter it becomes, and the higher it will rise in the liquid. An egg that will float on the surface of the liquid is of too questionable a character to be used without breaking, and is apt to be unfit for use at all. How to Keep Eggs. —To preserve the interior of an egg in its natural state, it is necessary to seal the pores of the shell air-tight, as the air which finds its way into the egg through the pores of the shell causes gradual decomposition. Various methods are devised to exclude the air and thus preserve the egg. A good way is to dip perfectly fresh eggs into a thick solution of gum-arabic,—equal parts of gum and water,—let the eggs dry and dip them again, taking care that the shells are entirely covered with the solution each time. When dry, wrap separately in paper and pack in a box of sawdust, bran, salt, or powdered charcoal, and cover tightly to keep out the air. There is a difference of opinion as to which end should be placed down in packing; most authorities recommend the smaller end. However, an experienced poultryman offers the following reasons for packing with the larger end down: \"The air-chamber is in the larger end, and if that is placed down, the yolk will not break through and touch the shell and thereby spoil. Another thing: if the air- chamber is down, the egg is not so liable to shrink away.\" It would be well for housekeepers to make the test by packing eggs from the same lot each way and noting the result. Melted wax or suet may be used to coat the shells. Eggs are sometimes immersed and kept in a solution of lime water, a pound of lime to a gallon of cold water, or simply packed in bran or salt, without a previous coating of fat or gum.","page_number":388,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 795, \"characters\": 4363}","created_at":"2025-09-09 10:43:01.979126+00"},{"id":"000f969c-39e7-40ee-bb35-f85408e503df","book_id":"b43a2b37-708b-41aa-8f02-e59ac61f61cb","chunk_index":40,"content":"But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended. Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening. On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished to engage them for both. \"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he, \"for we shall be quite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\" Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. \"And who knows but you may raise a dance,\" said she. \"And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.\" \"A dance!\" cried Marianne. \"Impossible! Who is to dance?\" \"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.—What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\" \"I wish with all my soul,\" cried Sir John, \"that Willoughby were among us again.\" This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting. She gave him a brief reply. Marianne's countenance was more communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a whisper, \"I have been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Shall I tell you.\" \"Certainly.\" 89 \"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.\" Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said, \"Oh, Edward! How can you?—But the time will come I hope...I am sure you will like him.\" \"I do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it. 90 C HAPTER 19 Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved—he grew more and more partial to the house and environs—never spoke of going away without a sigh—declared his time to be wholly disengaged—even doubted to what place he should go when he left them—but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly—he could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time. Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. The old well- established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,—when Mrs. Ferrars would be 91 reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.","page_number":86,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 781, \"characters\": 4470}","created_at":"2025-07-19 11:32:57.878672+00"},{"id":"00156300-6f0c-4e78-896f-51495a40acc4","book_id":"fedad722-f4d3-40f4-9175-f2f45db78587","chunk_index":79,"content":"Every passenger-carrying steamer is provided with refrigerating rooms for the storage of perishable provisions; and as the comfort of the passengers, not to say their luxury, is bound up with these compartments, it will be interesting to glance at the method employed for creating local frost amid surrounding heat. The big principle underlying the refrigerator is this—that a liquid when turned into gas absorbs heat (thus, to convert water into steam you must feed it with heat from a fire), and that as soon as the gas loses a certain amount of its heat it reverts to liquid form. Now take ammonia gas. The \"spirits of hartshorn\" we buy at the chemist's is water impregnated with this gas. At ordinary living temperatures the water gives out the gas, as a sniff at the bottle proves in a most effective manner. If this gas were cooled to 37·3° below zero it would assume a liquid state, i.e. that temperature marks its boiling point. Similarly steam, cooled to 212° Fahr., becomes water. Boiling point, therefore, merely means the temperature at which the change occurs. Ammonia liquid, when gasifying, absorbs a great amount of heat from its surroundings—air, water, or whatever they may be. So that if we put a tumbler full of the liquid into a basin of water it would rob the water of enough heat to cause the formation of ice. The refrigerating machine, generally employed on ships, is one which constantly turns the ammonia liquid into gas, and the gas back into liquid. The first process produces the cold used in the freezing-rooms. The apparatus consists of three main parts:— (1) The compressor , for squeezing ammonia gas. (2) The condenser , for liquefying the gas. (3) The evaporator , for gasifying the liquid. The compressor is a pump. The condenser , a tube or series of tubes outside which cold water is circulated. The evaporator , a spiral tube or tubes passing through a vessel full of brine. Between the condenser and evaporator is a valve, which allows the liquid to pass from the one to the other in proper quantities. We can now watch the cycle of operations. The compressor sucks in a charge of very cold gas from the evaporator, and squeezes it into a fraction of its original volume, thereby heating it. The heated gas now passes into the condenser coils and, as it expands, encounters the chilling effects of the water circulating outside, which robs it of heat and causes it to liquefy. It is next slowly admitted through the expansion valve into the evaporator. Here it gradually picks up the heat necessary for its gaseous form: taking it from the brine outside the coils, which has a very low freezing-point. The brine is circulated by pumps through pipes lining the walls of the freezing-room, and robs the air there of its heat until a temperature somewhat below the freezing-point of water is reached. The room is well protected by layers of charcoal or silicate cotton, which are very bad conductors of heat. How the chamber strikes a novice can be gathered from the following description of a Cunard liner's refrigerating room. \"It is a curious and interesting sight. It may be a hot day on deck, nearing New York, and everyone is going about in sun hats and light clothes. We descend a couple of flights of stairs, turn a key, and here is winter, sparkling in glassy frost upon the pale carcases of fowls and game, and ruddy joints of meat, crystallising the yellow apples and black grapes to the likeness of sweetmeats in a grocer's shop, gathering on the wall-pipes in scintillating coats of snow nearly an inch deep. You can make a snowball down here, if you like, and carry it up on deck to astonish the languid loungers sheltering from the sun under the protection of the promenade- deck roof. Such is the modern substitute for the old-time salt-beef cask and bags of dried pease!\" The larder is so near the kitchen that while below decks we may just peep into the kitchens, where a white-capped chef presides over an army of assistants. Inside a huge oven are dozens of joints turning round and round by the agency of an invisible electric-motor. But what most tickles the imagination is an electrical egg-boiling apparatus, which ensures the correct amount of cooking to any egg. A row of metal dippers, with perforated bottoms, is suspended over a trough of boiling water. Each dipper is marked for a certain time—one minute, two, three, four, and so on. The dippers, filled with eggs, are pushed down into the water.","page_number":204,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 776, \"characters\": 4467}","created_at":"2025-10-08 18:14:15.62875+00"},{"id":"0015884f-b38c-41fb-a3a5-45b1d1f3f9c3","book_id":"f032b518-ffa8-4d3a-af26-4b8a28dc4472","chunk_index":607,"content":"Selah. 66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him. 66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves.

Lo, on the other side, rises also a man, and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere. Then already is our first speaker, not man, but only a first speaker. His only redress is forthwith to draw a cir cle outside of his antagonist. And so men do by themselves. The result of to-day which haunts the mind and, cannot be escaped, will presently be abridged into a word, and the principle that seemed to explain nature, will itself be included as one exam ple of a bolder generalization. In the thought of to morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of the nations, and mar shal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted. Every man is not so much a workman in CIRCLES. 253 the world, as he is a suggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next age. Step by step we scale this mysterious ladder : the steps are actions ; the new prospect is power. Every several result is threatened and judged by that which follows. Every one seems to be contradicted by the new ; it is only limited by the new. The new state ment is always hated by the old, and, to those dwell ing in the old, comes like an abyss of skepticism. But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are effects of one cause ; then its innocency and benefit appear, and, presently, all its energy spent, it pales and dwindles before the revelation of the new hour. Fear not the new generalization. Does the fact look crass and material, threatening to degrade thy theory of spirit ? Resist it not ; it goes to refine and raise thy theory of matter just as much. There are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to con sciousness. Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood ; and if there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can be otherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel, was never opened ; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is, every man believes that he has a greater possibility. Our moods do not believe in each other. To-day, I am full of thoughts, and can write what I please. I see no reason why I should not have the same thought, the same power of expression to-morrow. What I write, whilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world : but, yesterday, I saw a dreary vacuity in 254 ESSAY X. this direction in which now I see so much ; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages. Alas for this infirm faith, this will not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow ! I am God in nature ; I am a weed by the wall. The continual effort to raise himself above himself, to work a pitch above his last height, betrays itself in a man's relations. We thirst for approbation, yet can not forgive the approver. The sweet of nature is love ; yet if I have a friend, I am tormented by my imperfections. The love of me accuses the other party. If he were high enough to slight me, then could I love him, and rise by my affection to new heights. A man's growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends. For every friend whom he loses for truth, he gains a better. I thought, as I walked in the woods and mused on my friends, why should I play with them this game of idolatry ? I know and see too well, when not voluntarily blind, the speedy limits of persons called high and worthy.","page_number":247,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 798, \"characters\": 4105}","created_at":"2025-08-26 05:03:13.031804+00"},{"id":"001952ac-9a33-4ac2-8fc4-1d041f6441cd","book_id":"f768937a-b2a4-47c7-9818-48e3ba8caeef","chunk_index":59,"content":"And from this garden spot of plenty a curling trail wound up the mountainside to the very level where we sat gazing down upon this last stronghold of our foes. 135 EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS When the ancients built that trail it must have been wide and beautiful indeed, but in the centuries that elapsed man and the elements have sadly defaced it. The rains have washed it away in places, and the Kalkars have made great gashes in it to deter us, their enemies, from invading their sole remaining lands and driving them into the sea; and upon their side of the gashes they had built forts where they keep warriors always. It is so upon_every pass that leads down into their country. And well for them that they do so guard themselves! Since fell my great ancestor, Julian 9th, in the year 2122, at the end of the first uprising against the Kalkars, we have been driving them slowly back across the world. That was more than three hundred years ago. For a hundred years they have held us here, a day’s ride from the ocean. Just how far it is we do not know; but in 2408 my grandfather, Julian 18th, rode alone almost to the sea. He had won back nearly to safety when he was discov- ered and pursued almost to the tents of his people. There was a battle, and the Kalkars who had dared invade our country were destroyed, but Julian 18th died of his wounds without being able to tell more than that a won- drously rich country lay between us and the sea, which was not more than a day’s ride distant. A day’s ride, for us, might be anything under a hundred miles. We are desert people. Our herds range a vast territory where feed is scarce, that we may be always near the goal that our ancestors set for us three centuries ago—the shore of the western sea into which it is our destiny to drive the remnants of our former oppressors. In the forests and mountains of Arizona there is rich pasture, but it is far from the land of the Kalkars where the last of the tribe of Or-tis make their last stand, and so we prefer to live in the desert near our foes, driving our herds 136 THE RED HAWK great distances to pasture when the need arises, rather than to settle down in a comparative land of plenty, resigning the age old struggle, the ancient feud between the house of Julian and the house of Or-tis. A light breeze moves the black mane of the bright bay stallion beneath me. It moves my own black mane where it falls loose below the buckskin thong that encircles my head and keeps it from my eyes. It moves the dangling ends of the Great Chief’s blanket strapped behind my saddle. On the twelfth day of the eighth month of the year just gone this Great Chief’s blanket covered the shoulders of my father, Julian 19th, from the burning rays of the summer’s desert sun. I was twenty on that day, and on that day my father fell before the lance of an Or-tis in the Great Feud, and I became the Chief of Chiefs. Surrounding me to-day as I sit looking down upon the land of my enemies are fifty of the fierce chieftains of the hundred clans that swear allegiance to the house of Julian. They are bronzed and, for the most part, beardless men. The insignias of their clans are painted in various colors upon their foreheads, their cheeks, their breasts. Ocher they use, and blue and white and scarlet. Feathers rise from the head bands that confine their hair—the feathers of the vulture, the hawk, and the eagle. I, Julian 20th, wear a single feather. It is from a red-tailed hawk—the clan sign of my family. We are all garbed similarly. Let me describe the Wolf, and in his portrait you will see a composite of us all. He is a sinewy, well built man of fifty, with piercing gray-blue eyes beneath straight brows. His head is well shaped, denoting great intelligence. His features are strong and powerful and of a certain fierce cast that might well strike terror to a foeman’s heart—and does, if the Kalkar scalps 137 EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS that fringe his ceremonial blanket stand for aught. His breeches, wide about the hips and skin tight from above the knees down, are of the skin of the buck deer. His soft boots, tied tight about the calf of each leg, are also of buck. Above the waist he wears a sleeveless vest of calfskin tanned with the hair on. The Wolf’s is of fawn and white.","page_number":130,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 795, \"characters\": 4276}","created_at":"2025-10-27 17:20:25.805724+00"},{"id":"001ac202-1e9b-43d5-8e23-0def52b776b4","book_id":"9a7d2ebe-5a2e-4606-996a-e6e5d1f81762","chunk_index":118,"content":"This being so, equals must e ff ect the required equalization on a basis of equality in love and in all other respects, while unequals must render what is in proportion to their superiority or inferiority. Complaints and reproaches arise either only or chie fl y in the friendship of utility, and this is only to be expected. For those who are friends on the ground of virtue are anxious to do well by each other (since that is a mark of virtue and of friendship), and between men who are emulating each other in this there cannot be com- plaints or quarrels; no one is o ff ended by a man who loves him and does well by him — if he is a person of nice feeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the other. And the man who excels the other in the services he renders will not complain of his friend, since he gets what he aims at; for each man desires what is good. * Nor do complaints arise much even in friendships of pleasure; for both get at the same time what they desire, if they enjoy spending their time together; and a man who complained of another for not a ff ording him pleasure would seem ridiculous, since it is in his power not to spend his days with him. But the friendship of utility is full of complaints; for as they use each other for their own interests they always want to get the better of the bargain, and think they have got less than they should, and blame their partners because they do not get all they ‘want and deserve’; and those who do well by others cannot help them as much as those whom they bene fi t want. 1 1113 a 22 – 33 . 30 35 1162 b 5 10 15 20 the nicomachean ethics viii.13 160 Now it seems that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and the other legal, one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the other legal. * And so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolve the relation in the spirit of the same type of friendship in which they contracted it. The legal type is that which is on fi xed terms; its purely commercial variety is on the basis of immediate payment, while the more liberal variety allows time but stipulates for a de fi nite quid pro quo . In this variety the debt is clear and not ambiguous, but in the postponement it contains an element of friendliness; and so some states do not allow suits arising out of such agreements, but think men who have bargained on a basis of credit ought to accept the consequences. The moral type is not on fi xed terms; it makes a gift, or does whatever it does, as to a friend; but one expects to receive as much or more, as having not given but lent; and if a man is worse o ff when the relation is dissolved than he was when it was contracted he will complain. This happens because all or most men, while they wish for what is noble, choose what is advantageous; now it is noble to do well by another without a view to repayment, but it is the receiving of bene fi ts that is advantageous. Therefore if we can we should return the equivalent of what we have received (for we must not make a man our friend against his will; we must recognize that we were mistaken at the fi rst and took a bene fi t from a person we should not have taken it from — since it was not from a friend, nor from one who did it just for the sake of acting so — and we must settle up just as if we had been bene fi ted on fi xed terms). Indeed, one would agree to repay if one could (if one could not, even the giver would not have expected one to do so); therefore if it is possible we must repay. But at the outset we must consider the man by whom we are being bene fi ted and on what terms he is acting, in order that we may accept the bene fi t on these terms, or else decline it. It is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its util- ity to the receiver and make the return with a view to that, or by the bene fi cence of the giver.","page_number":187,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 772, \"characters\": 3851}","created_at":"2025-11-19 20:08:31.090633+00"},{"id":"0021d692-642a-4baf-b381-9e92730df459","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":1105,"content":"What treason were it to the ransack’d queen, Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me, Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion!

This is why the nature story that is true to the facts of science is the one that interests the boy or girl. It is like the racial tale, full of conflict, of temporary defeat and final triumph. The young salmon grown old, struggling up Snake River to the foot of the Bitter Root Mountains, was sore of muscle and unsightly of skin, and his tail was frayed and torn, but the desire of his nature was fulfilled at last. He scooped out a nest and covered the eggs of his companion, and then, because the work of his life was done, was free to drift downstream. Such stories give insight into nature and engender a love of nature; and besides quickening the imagination and enriching the emotional life, they help to give stability to the child character, because through them he learns the workings of certain inexorable laws. There is such a vast amount of material to use in teaching nature study, that the suggestions and bibliography given in this chapter can by no means be comprehensive. In the realm of geology there is the story of limestone, of slate, of quartz and granite, of rock salt and sandstone, and particularly interesting to the child is the story of coal. For him it abounds in color, and beautiful indeed are the pictures that he sees as he listens to this narrative of the carboniferous forests that grew in the beginning of time, of the lush, dank swamps of the Permian or Triassic or Miocene Period, and the strange animal life that peopled them. From astronomy and botany one may glean as much as from geology, while entomology, zoölogy, and ichthyology hold untold delights for the child. A wonderful science story is that of the coral polyp, building from some submerged cliff or crag until a little island rises above the blue water. In my own childhood it meant as much as ever a fairy tale meant, and I can still feel the pleasure I experienced the first time I heard it. It is full of mystery and wonder, and a story of rare beauty for the child. I have used it often in story-telling, and it never fails to bring enthusiastic response; and very popular with the children is this song of the insect builders, of which I do not know the authorship, but which is one of the fragrant memories of my childhood: Far down in the depths of the deep blue sea, An insect train works ceaselessly; Moment by moment and day by day, Never stopping to rest or play, Rock upon rock they are rearing high, Till the top looks out on the sunny sky: The gentle winds and the balmy air Little by little bring verdure there, Till the summer sunbeams gayly smile On the birds and flowers of the little isle. Older children enjoy hearing about the different forms of coral, of the characteristics of that of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, and of the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic. They enjoy, too, hearing about the coral industry, of the fishing for it along the shores of Africa, of the departure of the seekers from Sicily, of the Feast of the Coral Fishers that is such a picturesque feature of the island life, of the polishing and carving and preparing the product for trade; they like the legend the southern Italians tell of how the first medallion in Sicily was made as an offering of gratitude by a fisher lad to the young Princess of Naples. From beginning to end the coral story is a narrative that charms the child, and it is but one of the forms of sea life, which holds rich opportunities for the narrator, while sea life is but one of the fields of science from which he can glean with splendid results. In fact, the possibilities for story work in the teaching of science are almost beyond imagining until one begins to survey the field and enumerate sources of material, and the story-teller will be restricted in it only by her ability to organize material and present it to the children in story form. Sometimes writers, thinking they will make nature stories more enjoyable to boys and girls, people them with supernatural folk who are supposed to be responsible for the marvels that occur in them. It is a practice that scientists decry, and it is condemned by all who believe that a story fit to give to children must be worthy of the name of literature, and consequently, whether fact or fiction, must be true in spirit.","page_number":137,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 782, \"characters\": 4343}","created_at":"2025-07-12 19:52:47.735794+00"},{"id":"0028c9bb-bab4-4e00-8920-4a7c50c8ef88","book_id":"0bed4a50-9ec5-46c1-80c4-e73ce6b48974","chunk_index":66,"content":"The hours in which convictions were upon me were such troublesome and such heart-affrighting hours that I could not bear, no not so much as the remembrance of them, upon my heart. CHR. Then, as it seems, sometimes you got rid of your trouble. HOPE. Yes, verily, but it would come into my mind again, and then I should be as bad, nay, worse, than I was before. CHR. Why, what was it that brought your sins to mind again? {341} HOPE. Many things; as, 1. If I did but meet a good man in the streets; or, 2. If I have heard any read in the Bible; or, 3. If mine head did begin to ache; or, 4. If I were told that some of my neighbours were sick; or, 5. If I heard the bell toll for some that were dead; or, 6. If I thought of dying myself; or, 7. If I heard that sudden death happened to others; 8. But especially, when I thought of myself, that I must quickly come to judgment. {342} CHR. And could you at any time, with ease, get off the guilt of sin, when by any of these ways it came upon you? HOPE. No, not I, for then they got faster hold of my conscience; and then, if I did but think of going back to sin, (though my mind was turned against it), it would be double torment to me. CHR. And how did you do then? HOPE. I thought I must endeavour to mend my life; for else, thought I, I am sure to be damned. {343} CHR. And did you endeavour to mend? HOPE. Yes; and fled from not only my sins, but sinful company too; and betook me to religious duties, as prayer, reading, weeping for sin, speaking truth to my neighbours, &c. These things did I, with many others, too much here to relate. CHR. And did you think yourself well then? HOPE. Yes, for a while; but at the last, my trouble came tumbling upon me again, and that over the neck of all my reformations. {344} CHR. How came that about, since you were now reformed? HOPE. There were several things brought it upon me, especially such sayings as these: “All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.” [Isa. 64:6] “By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.” [Gal. 2:16] “When ye shall have done all those things, say, We are unprofitable”, [Luke 17:10] with many more such like. From whence I began to reason with myself thus: If ALL my righteousnesses are filthy rags; if, by the deeds of the law, NO man can be justified; and if, when we have done ALL, we are yet unprofitable, then it is but a folly to think of heaven by the law. I further thought thus: If a man runs a hundred pounds into the shopkeeper’s debt, and after that shall pay for all that he shall fetch; yet, if this old debt stands still in the book uncrossed, for that the shopkeeper may sue him, and cast him into prison till he shall pay the debt. CHR. Well, and how did you apply this to yourself? HOPE. Why; I thought thus with myself. I have, by my sins, run a great way into God’s book, and that my now reforming will not pay off that score; therefore I should think still, under all my present amendments, But how shall I be freed from that damnation that I have brought myself in danger of by my former transgressions? {345} CHR. A very good application: but, pray, go on. HOPE. Another thing that hath troubled me, even since my late amendments, is, that if I look narrowly into the best of what I do now, I still see sin, new sin, mixing itself with the best of that I do; so that now I am forced to conclude, that notwithstanding my former fond conceits of myself and duties, I have committed sin enough in one duty to send me to hell, though my former life had been faultless. CHR. And what did you do then? {346} HOPE. Do! I could not tell what to do, until I brake my mind to Faithful, for he and I were well acquainted. And he told me, that unless I could obtain the righteousness of a man that never had sinned, neither mine own, nor all the righteousness of the world could save me. CHR.

To this belief Demi held fast, and in it found both help and comfort, because it led him unconsciously through a tender longing for the father whom he had seen to a childlike trust in the Father whom he had not seen. Both were in heaven, and he prayed to both, trying to be good for love of them. The outward change corresponded to the inward, for in those few weeks Demi seemed to have grown tall, and began to drop his childish plays, not as if ashamed of them, as some boys do, but as if he had outgrown them, and wanted something manlier. He took to the hated arithmetic, and held on so 255 steadily that his uncle was charmed, though he could not understand the whim, until Demi said,– \"I am going to be a bookkeeper when I grow up, like papa, and I must know about figures and things, else I can't have nice, neat ledgers like his.\" At another time he came to his aunt with a very serious face, and said– \"What can a small boy do to earn money?\" \"Why do you ask, my deary?\" \"My father told me to take care of mother and the little girls, and I want to, but I don't know how to begin.\" \"He did not mean now, Demi, but by and by, when you are large.\" \"But I wish to begin now , if I can, because I think I ought to make some money to buy things for the family. I am ten, and other boys no bigger than I earn pennies sometimes.\" \"Well, then, suppose you rake up all the dead leaves and cover the strawberry bed. I'll pay you a dollar for the job,\" said Aunt Jo. \"Isn't that a great deal? I could do it in one day. You must be fair, and no pay too much, because I want to truly earn it.\" \"My little John, I will be fair, and not pay a penny too much. Don't work too hard; and when that is done I will have something else for you to do,\" said Mrs. Jo, much touched by his desire to help, and his sense of justice, so like his scrupulous father. When the leaves were done, many barrowloads of chips were wheeled from the wood to the shed, and another dollar earned. Then Demi helped cover the schoolbooks, working in the evenings under Franz's direction, tugging patiently away at each book, letting no one help, and receiving his wages with such satisfaction that the dingy bills became quite glorified in his sight. \"Now, I have a dollar for each of them, and I should like to take my money to mother all myself, so she can see that I have minded my father.\" 256 So Demi made a duteous pilgrimage to his mother, who received his little earnings as a treasure of great worth, and would have kept it untouched, if Demi had not begged her to buy some useful thing for herself and the women-children, whom he felt were left to his care. This made him very happy, and, though he often forgot his responsibilities for a time, the desire to help was still there, strengthening with his years. He always uttered the words \"my father\" with an air of gentle pride, and often said, as if he claimed a title full of honor, \"Don't call me Demi any more. I am John Brooke now.\" So, strengthened by a purpose and a hope, the little lad of ten bravely began the world, and entered into his inheritance,–the memory of a wise and tender father, the legacy of an honest name. 257 C HAPTER 20. R OUND T HE F IRE WITH the October frosts came the cheery fires in the great fireplaces; and Demi's dry pine-chips helped Dan's oak-knots to blaze royally, and go roaring up the chimney with a jolly sound. All were glad to gather round the hearth, as the evenings grew longer, to play games, read, or lay plans for the winter. But the favorite amusement was story-telling, and Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer were expected to have a store of lively tales always on hand.

I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.” I said to him:— “Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant’s delay.” The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:— “Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.” The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:— “Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation.” So I said:— “I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.” The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said:— “We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:— “I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We’ll have to look back—and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:— “My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation—for a short time, at all events.","page_number":264,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 749, \"characters\": 3986}","created_at":"2025-09-04 19:06:48.07595+00"},{"id":"002c946a-35f2-410e-9ef2-972c3987124b","book_id":"49205f8d-8c69-44f2-b6f8-93df72ef1ee9","chunk_index":54,"content":"The psychological effect of the thought of an event as inevitable, it is true, is in any case calming, but the tranquillity thus induced is a heavy and hopeless one. And those who accept the inevitable in this stupefying manner often become meaner in their way of living. The light of life is for them extinguished. They put up perhaps with creature comforts, or with work that merely keeps the mind occupied, and prevents it from fretting the wound, thus allowing slow time to cicatrize it. There is, however, a larger way in which a materialist may regard the inevitable. The world in his view being a vast machine, he may, as it were, identify himself with the machine, and thereby rise in thought superior to the injury it inflicts on him. But though we can imagine someone thus deadening his feelings when he himself is the victim, we cannot well conceive of the same remedy applying when a beloved person, say an only child, is being crushed under the Juggernaut car of the world-machine. The great test of one’s philosophy of life is whether it helps us in the case of those whom we love, rather than in the case of the sufferings we experience in our own person. A second consolation is: Remember the universality of sorrow. Look around you, behold the vast multitude who are suffering like you; remember the countless generations who have suffered in the past, think of the generations to come that will suffer in like manner. Such are some of the consolations of the choruses in the Greek tragedies. Latent perhaps in this mournful view of the facts of existence is another aspect of the matter, namely, the uprising from frustration toward ideal realization. And in so far as this other uplifting view is indeed latent or suggested, the thought of the universality of sorrow has an ennobling effect. On the other hand, without the explication of what may be regarded as implicit in them the consolations of the Greek choruses are inexpressibly saddening. A third and active variant of the former consolation is: Seek to mitigate the sorrow and trouble of thy fellow-sufferers. Appease the passion of thine own grief by compassion and the works to which it leads. And by as much as activity of any kind is better than passivity, or mere feeling, by so much is this third kind of consolation better than the ones above mentioned. But at bottom the same criticism applies to it. It leaves still unanswered the question, To what end this suffering both of others and of oneself? Not Why? is the question, but To what end? How bereavement may be used so as to bring it into relation with the final end of life? A fourth consolation is the popular belief in immortality. This is a resort to supernaturalism, and the supernatural should ever be distinguished from the supersensible. Immortality as popularly held involves the continued existence in some empirical form of the essential, central entity in man. For the suggestion that new organs may replace the wornout terrestrial body does not alter the empirical character of the conception. The new organs are still conceived in some vague fashion as similar to those with which we are acquainted. Finally, my own interpretation of consolation may be set forth in contrast to all these. Again I say that for the bereaved, as for the sick, there is business in hand, there is a task to be performed, a work to be done. What is it? Let me endeavor to explain. The spiritual nature of man is incognizable, only the plan of the relations between spirit and spirit being given. Yet to think of a relation at all we must think of entities or objects between which it subsists. Of the spiritual part of our fellow-beings, therefore, we are bound to fashion mentally a symbolic image, one that shall stand for the real object, the spiritual nature, though we are well aware that it does not adequately express it. When the beloved person is no longer visibly present, the work we do upon the symbolic image of him is not to cease. We are to review, to summarize the whole existence of a departed friend, as we have probably never done while he was with us. We are to get the total perspective of his life, to see the fine qualities standing out more distinctly; to seize the net result of his existence so far as those character traits are concerned which in him were most analogous to spiritual traits. This image we can now ideally contemplate with the advantage that none of the actual infirmities of his nature can mar it, and that no future events can henceforth alter our impression.","page_number":98,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 797, \"characters\": 4540}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:52:53.859128+00"},{"id":"002e63da-cd29-49ef-81f2-f09b8a7be492","book_id":"0906dc3f-7b39-417a-ac98-ada01b9bafc7","chunk_index":4,"content":"The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened. \"Come back,\" he said, tenderly. \"You will be cold.\" \"It is colder for my son,\" said the old woman, and wept afresh. The sound of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start. \"The paw!\" she cried wildly. \"The monkey's paw!\" He started up in alarm. \"Where? Where is it? What's the matter?\" She came stumbling across the room toward him. \"I want it,\" she said, quietly. \"You've not destroyed it?\" \"It's in the parlour, on the bracket,\" he replied, marvelling. \"Why?\" She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek. \"I only just thought of it,\" she said, hysterically. \"Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?\" \"Think of what?\" he questioned. \"The other two wishes,\" she replied, rapidly. \"We've only had one.\" \"Was not that enough?\" he demanded, fiercely. \"No,\" she cried, triumphantly; \"we'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\" The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. \"Good God, you are mad!\" he cried, aghast. \"Get it,\" she panted; \"get it quickly, and wish—Oh, my boy, my boy!\" Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. \"Get back to bed,\" he said, unsteadily. \"You don't know what you are saying.\" \"We had the first wish granted,\" said the old woman, feverishly; \"why not the second?\" \"A coincidence,\" stammered the old man. \"Go and get it and wish,\" cried his wife, quivering with excitement. The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. \"He has been dead ten days, and besides he—I would not tell you else, but—I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\" \"Bring him back,\" cried the old woman, and dragged him toward the door. \"Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?\" He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand. Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her. \"Wish!\" she cried, in a strong voice. \"It is foolish and wicked,\" he faltered. \"Wish!\" repeated his wife. He raised his hand. \"I wish my son alive again.\" The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind. He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him. Neither spoke, but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle. At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door. The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him.","page_number":13,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 774, \"characters\": 4228}","created_at":"2025-08-20 04:03:36.342479+00"},{"id":"0030c481-c56b-46c6-8d87-e66d306a0002","book_id":"fb8da36e-392c-4741-b500-fb0a10cd15ef","chunk_index":192,"content":"I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side, 390 such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.—'Jane,' indeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.— She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each : she dissolved it .—This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her 391 extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my uncle.","page_number":366,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 695, \"characters\": 3817}","created_at":"2025-07-19 11:55:36.574068+00"},{"id":"0034e28e-a84c-4e16-9387-5504d0a4e9e3","book_id":"cf302acf-5864-4a44-8cfd-9d3f425a4305","chunk_index":61,"content":"Some handsome copper work is also produced in Srinagar, and some pretty enamel work. But at present the fashion rather turns to wood-carving, which has certainly much improved since I first knew it. Very handsome screens, tables, panels, boxes, etc., are made, and the Kashmiri carpenter is getting to finish his work much better. Whether the work is worth the prices asked is, I think, doubtful. Better wood-carving can be had in Europe for the same price. Turning from art industries to more practical manufactures the first to notice is basket-work. Most villages have their artisan who makes baskets for agricultural purposes, for carrying loads and for rough village work. Willow trees are plentiful and might be much more extensively grown; and Raja Sir Amar Singh\n\nhas always been keenly interested in establishing a really important basket industry in Kashmir, and supplying the needs not merely of Kashmir villagers, but of India generally. Puttoo cloth and blankets are well-known manufactures of Kashmir. Since the Swadeshi   movement has extended in India, and the demand for goods made in India has increased, there has been a regular run on the rough woollen \"puttoo\" of Kashmir, and the price has gone up. Formerly a sportsman could get a good shikar suit for eight rupees. Now he has to pay ten or twelve. It is excellent wearing material, but is too loosely woven and liable to get out of shape. Proposals are on foot for establishing woollen factories in Kashmir, and with suitable machinery and proper supervision, good useful cloth should be made from the excellent wool with which the country abounds. Cotton cloth is also manufactured in the villages, of a rough, homely description. But whether this manufacture will ever increase to a great extent is doubtful. A French gentleman who has lived for many years in Bokhara, and who visited Kashmir, told me that he considered that as cotton was grown so successfully in Bokhara and Russian Turkestan, it ought to grow equally well in Kashmir. This may be so, and the State is making experiments in cotton growing to find a variety suitable to the country. But so far the future of cotton manufacture cannot be considered so assured as that of silk and wool. Finally, among the industries of Kashmir must be mentioned boat-building, which is indeed one of the most important in the country. The Kashmiri is an intelligent and clever carpenter, though in accordance with his character he lacks accuracy and finish. His boats are of all sizes, from the great grain barges, carrying cargoes of thirty tons, to State \"parindas\" or fliers propelled by forty or fifty rowers, and to light skiffs for a couple of paddlers. House-boats of quite elaborate design are also made. And if properly supervised and instructed, the Kashmiri should be capable of constructing any kind of craft. There is little iron-work in Kashmir, for iron is not plentiful. But the Kashmiri has such natural skill that he can turn out quite good guns and rifles, and will make all the ordinary surgical instruments required in the hospital. T RADE Of these products and manufactures considerable quantities are exported to India, and will help to make the proposed railway pay, while this railway on its\n\npart will help to increase the exports, for much that cannot be taken out of the country, now that everything has to be carried 196 miles by road, would be exported if railway carriage were available. Apples and pears to the extent of 90,000 maunds, or 3210 tons, are exported annually, besides from 10,000 to 20,000 maunds of other fruit. Rice and maize exports vary greatly according to the demand in the Punjab. The present year was one of scarcity in the adjoining British province, and, consequently, the export of grain was quite unusual— amounting to 100,000 maunds, or more than three thousand tons; but ordinarily it does not exceed more than about a thousand tons. The export of ghi or clarified butter amounts to 720 tons. Potatoes are an increasingly important export, and the demand for them is certain to rise. Last year 750 tons were exported. Hides and skins to the amount of some 350 tons are annually exported. Linseed was in special demand last year owing to the failure of crops in the Punjab, and in consequence 1740 tons, to the value of Rs. 2,61,000, were exported; but the usual amount is only about one-fifth of this. Silk to the value of Rs. 18,44,205 was exported last year, and this may be taken as the normal amount. And wool and woollen goods, to the value of about two lakhs of rupees, are also exported, besides a few miscellaneous articles, and some 4000 live animals, mostly sheep and goats.","page_number":115,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 793, \"characters\": 4669}","created_at":"2025-07-08 05:20:33.180095+00"},{"id":"003636a6-ea5b-4fd5-acbd-5b93177e9313","book_id":"ffd7d308-afae-4ddb-a41f-bdcb34931226","chunk_index":12,"content":"And in those days there could not have been many boys from Sorath in a class of forty to fifty. My own recollection is that I had not any high regard for my ability. I used to be astonished whenever I won prizes and scholarships. But I very jealously guarded my character. The least little blemish drew tears from my eyes. When I merited, or seemed to the teacher to merit, a rebuke, it was unbearable for me. I remember having once received corporal punishment. I did not so much mind the punishment, as the fact that it was considered my desert. I wept piteously. That was when I was in the first or second standard. There was another such incident during the time when I was in the seventh standard. Dorabji Edulji Gimi was the headmaster then. He was popular among boys, as he was a disciplinarian, a man of method and a good teacher. He had made gymnastics and cricket compulsory for boys of the upper standards. I disliked both. I never took part in any exercise, cricket or football, before they were made compulsory. My shyness was one of the reasons for this aloofness, which I An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org Page 35 now see was wrong. I then had the false notion that gymnastics had nothing to do with education. Today I know that physical training should have as much place in the curriculum as mental training. I may mention, however, that I was none the worse for abstaining from exercise. That was because I had read in books about the benefits of long walks in the open air and, having liked the advice, I had formed a habit of taking walks, which has still remained with me. These walks gave me a fairly hardy constitution. The reason for my dislike for gymnastics was my keen desire to serve as nurse to my father. As soon as the school closed, I would hurry home and begin serving him. Compulsory exercise came directly in the way of this service. I requested Mr. Gimi to exempt me from gymnastics so that I might be free to serve my father. But he would not listen to me. Now it so happened that one Saturday, when we had school in the morning, I had to go from home to the school for gymnastics at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I had no watch, and the clouds deceived me. Before I reached the school the boys had all left. The next day Mr. Gimi, examining the roll, found me marked absent. Being asked the reason for absence, I told him what had happened. He refused to believe me and ordered me to pay a fine of one or two annas (I cannot now recall how much). I was convicted of lying! That deeply pained me. How was I to prove my innocence? There was no way. I cried in deep anguish. I saw that a man of truth must also be a man of care. This was the first and last instance of my carelessness in school. I have a faint recollection that I finally succeeded in getting the fine remitted. The exemption from exercise was of course obtained, as my father wrote himself to the headmaster saying that he wanted me at home after school. But though I was none the worse for having neglected exercise, I am still paying the penalty of another neglect. I do not know whence I got the notion that good handwriting was not a necessary part of education, but I retained it until I went to England. When later, especially in South Africa, I saw the beautiful An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org Page 36 handwriting of lawyers and young men born and educated in South Africa, I was ashamed of myself and repented of my neglect. I saw that bad handwriting should be regarded as a sign of an imperfect education. I tried later to improve mine, but it was too late. I could never repair the neglect of my youth. Let every young man and woman be warned by my example, and understand that good handwriting is a necessary part of education. I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objects, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learnt to draw objects. He will then write a beautifully formed hand. Two more reminiscences of my school days are worth recording.","page_number":35,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 774, \"characters\": 4196}","created_at":"2025-07-27 08:33:45.574826+00"},{"id":"0038ce50-990a-403f-9e52-c130f064dedb","book_id":"9fcb3e2f-7651-4277-b30b-5c531a114163","chunk_index":5,"content":"At length the alphabet was mastered, and afterwards spelling, reading, and so forth. My mind being thus previously filled with ideas , the acquirement of words and abstract terms became less irksome, and I cannot remember that thus far it cost me any trouble, much less pain. Information of every kind fit for childhood then really gave me pleasure. No doubt I am greatly indebted to my parents for their judicious management. My father always in the evening, took great pains to explain things to me; he nurtured but never crammed; he knew when to teach and when to let alone. Unfortunately, through very peculiar circumstances, I was removed from the immediate care and superintendence of both parents rather early in life; and, at an age the most dangerous, was left to grapple nearly alone with the wide world and the beings in it, with little of either parental guidance. It was then I saw the immense importance and advantage of early impressions. To me they were of incalculable benefit, and no doubt led, when I became a man, to the thoughts which ended in the development and practical working of the Infant System and method of education. Schools for infants then existed, but what were they? Simply dame-schools, with the hornbook for boys and girls, and perhaps a little sewing for the latter. Their sign was—\"Children taught to read and work here,\" and their furniture the cap and bells, the rod in pickle, and a corner for dunces. The finishing stroke was seen in the parlour of the inn, or the farm-house, in the shape of needlework as a samplar;—\"Lydia Languish, her work, done at —— school, in the year of our Lord, 1809.\" Such were the schools in country places then in existence, the little ones doing nothing. In after-life, I thought a remedy was required and might be found, and therefore set about working it out. How it was done shall be hereafter explained. I knew my own infant state had been a happy one, and I wondered to see children crying to go to school, when learning had been such a delight to me. But I soon ceased to wonder when I was sent there myself. At my first school I can truly say I learnt nothing, except it be that I had especially the sense of feeling. I often had raps with the cane on the head, across the shoulders, and on the hand, and I found it was mainly for not learning what the teacher had forgotten to teach me . The terms used were \"master\" and \"mistress,\" and they were tolerably appropriate as far as I was concerned, for to me both became objects of terror, so much so, that for the first time in my life, I really fretted when the hour of teaching came. My parents were not long in perceiving this although I did not complain. They told me it was for my good that I should go to school, and I thoroughly believed them. Yet I could not understand why it should be associated with so much dislike and pain on my part, when my first school,— the beautiful world of nature, had been so lovely, and my first teachers had always increased the delight by removing my difficulties, and this so much so that I now longed for evening to come to have fresh light and instruction given. My father now decided that I should not go to school, and he became my teacher as before, the world being my great book. I was delighted with Robinson Crusoe, and this work became my companion, and to which was added the Pilgrim's Progress. After these, my great favourite was Buffon's Natural History. I used to go alone, taking a volume at a time, to read amidst the pleasant country around, but most frequently in the quiet nooks and retreats of Hornsey Wood. It seems, however, that I was always watched and superintended by my mother during these readings and rural rambles, for whenever danger was near she generally appeared, but seldom otherwise, so that I had perfect freedom in these matters. I have every reason to believe that the first seven years of my life laid the basis of all I know that is worth knowing, and led to the formation of my character and future career in life. Of my schooling afterwards it is unnecessary to say much, as it was the usual routine such as others had, but it never satisfied me, and I even then saw errors throughout the whole, and this strengthened my first impressions, and tended to mature the after-thought in me, that something wanted doing and must be done .","page_number":18,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 787, \"characters\": 4350}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:14:40.927908+00"},{"id":"003aab68-56f7-40c9-b02f-546bf745ce0a","book_id":"f0f9d817-d655-4e6b-8b6b-a981062fd068","chunk_index":134,"content":"We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one.

So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand—witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create—that noble ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust—as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small—we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire—solder you call it. He can see in the dark —no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference.","page_number":232,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 771, \"characters\": 4022}","created_at":"2025-09-04 19:06:48.07595+00"},{"id":"003ca703-21fa-4428-aeca-4d6647f4ffe9","book_id":"6c6f861f-bfad-409a-8007-d8283695cf88","chunk_index":84,"content":"He dived into the abysses of his memory, and recalled that he had offered him a deanery, which the Canon had refused. The man evidently wanted a bishopric or nothing. He remembered also something that his daughter had told him; he wondered what power the suave parson actually had with Sir John. “I hear that your son is going to marry Durant’s daughter,” he said, slowly. “You’ve been misinformed,” answered the Canon, with a smile that was somewhat ironical. “ I am going to marry her.” “You!” They looked at one another like two fencers, seeking to discover their strength in each other’s face. The Prime Minister’s eyes had a peculiar force which suggested the reason of his long-continued power; they lacked brilliancy, but there was in them a curious intensity of vision which seemed to absorb the thoughts of other men’s minds. The silence lasted interminably. Canon Spratte bore the great man’s gaze with perfect steadfastness, and presently Lord Stonehenge looked away. He stared out of the window, into space, and the Canon thought he had entirely forgotten the subject in hand. “I need not tell you that I will do everything I can to bring Durant to a reasonable state of mind. At present he’s wavering. You probably know the facts better than I do, but he tells me the liquor party will follow him. I understand if they go against you the result will be—awkward.” Lord Stonehenge apparently did not hear. His eyes still rested heavily on the trees in the park. Canon Spratte began to grow a little irritated, but still he waited patiently. At last the Prime Minister spoke. “I suppose you’ve heard that Gray is dead?” “I have.” “Would you like to go to Barchester?” Although he seemed desperately stupid Lord Stonehenge had understood. The Canon’s heart gave a leap and he caught his breath. He forgot that Barchester stood on a clay soil, and it no longer seemed a tedious place. At last! But he showed no eagerness to accept. He knew as well as the Prime Minister that the Government was in the hollow of his hand. At that moment a bishop came up to Lord Stonehenge with a telegram in his hand. Canon Spratte gave him an impatient frown. “I’m sorry to disturb you, but I think you ought to see this,” said the newcomer. He handed the telegram to Lord Stonehenge, who glanced at it irritably. The bishop knew Canon Spratte and nodded to him. “It’s to tell me that the Bishop of Sheffield died in his sleep early this morning. He’s been ailing for some time.” “Thank you,” said the Prime Minister. He returned the telegram, and the bishop withdrew. Canon Spratte and Lord Stonehenge looked at one another once more. A new factor had come into the game which they were playing. Beside Sheffield the diocese of Barchester was quite insignificant; it was small and poor, and from the city itself all prosperity had long since vanished. The bishop of such a place might be a great man in his own neighbourhood, but he had no chance of activity outside it. Sheffield, on the other hand, possessed two suffragans and patronage of vast importance. It was the centre of religious life in the Midlands. Year by year the town was growing in consequence; and its bishop, if a man of resource, might wield great power. By help of the rich manufacturers in his district he could raise huge sums for any purpose he pleased, and his influence need be second only to that of the archbishop. If it was possible to have Sheffield, Barchester was but a poor reward for such services as Theodore Spratte could render to his country. But he had no time to think it over. It was necessary to make his decision there and then. He was a bold man and did not hesitate. Lord Stonehenge still waited for his answer. “It’s very good of you to make me such an offer, and I need not say I am grateful for the honour, but—if I may put it frankly—I don’t think I feel inclined to go to such a dead and alive town as Barchester. I have a passion for work, and I can’t live without plenty to do. If I leave London at all it must be for a place that offers ample scope for a man of energy, a place where there’s a vigorous civic life, and where you may feel yourself, as it were, at the centre of this busy modern world of ours. Advance and progress are my watchwords.” Conversation with Lord Stonehenge was difficult, for he seldom opened his mouth.","page_number":159,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 781, \"characters\": 4329}","created_at":"2025-10-08 04:11:29.070541+00"},{"id":"003e4de4-168b-4851-a1dc-1e088f3453dd","book_id":"ecfe9883-0715-44e4-a292-9e6470b1a262","chunk_index":114,"content":"Ni menos les deben aprovechar sus llantos y lamentaciones miserables para que les tenga compasión, por más que imploren nuestros parientes ya difuntos y giman su soledad y desconsuelo, pues acordaos de nuestros compañeros muertos po ellos cruelmente, cuyos padres, o de muchos de ellos, murieron en la batalla de Queronea cuando os llevaban el socorro de Beocia, y los otros quedan ya viejos y desconsolados en sus casas, demandando la venganza con más justa razón que estos os piden el perdón, pues son dignos de misericordia los que contra justicia y razón sufren injurias, mal o daño; pero los que por su culpa los padecen, merecedores son de que los otros se alegren de su mal cuando lo vean en miserias y desventuras, como ahora están estos plateenses, solos y desamparados por su culpa, pues por su voluntad desecharon sus amigos y aliados, los mejores que tenían, y se apartaron de ellos, ofendiéndoles ante por odio y mal querencia que por razón, sin que les injuriásemos en cosa alguna, de modo que el mayor castigo será inferior al que merecen. »Y tampoco dicen verdad al suponer que se rindieron voluntariamente, viniendo con la manos alzadas en la batalla, sino que por pacto expreso se sometieron a vuestro juicio. Por tanto, siendo esto así, rogamos y requerimos a vosotros varones lacedemonios, que cumpláis las leyes de Grecia que estos malamente han quebrantado, dando a nosotros, sin razón ofendidos, la justa paga y galardón merecido a los servicios que hemos hecho, sin que por las razones de estos nos sea denegado. Y dad también ejemplo a todos los griegos, de que no paráis mientes tanto en las palabras como en los hechos, porque cuando la obras son buenas no requieren muchas palabras para alabarlas; mas para palia y dorar un mal hecho, son menester discursos artificiosos. »Si los que tienen la autoridad de juzgar y sentenciar, como vosotros la tenéis al presente, después de recopiladas todas las dudas, conociesen sumariamente y de plano de la causa, sin más largas y dilaciones, ninguno procuraría forjar lindas frases para excusar los hechos torpes y feos.» De esta manera hablaron los tebanos. Cuando los jueces lacedemonios hubieron oído ambas partes, determinaron perseverar en la pregunta que habían hecho al principio a los de Platea, es a saber: si durante la guerra prestaron algún beneficio a los lacedemonios porque les parecía que todo el tiempo anterior no se habían movido a hace mal ninguno, según las leyes y convenciones que Pausanias hiciera con ello después de la guerra de los medos, hasta tanto que recusaron las condicione para ser neutrales antes que se les pusiese el cerco, y porque después que lo de Platea rechazaron aquellas condiciones, los lacedemonios no quedaban ya obligados por el convenio de Pausanias. Por esta razón los de Platea merecían todo el mal que les viniese de su parte. Les llamaron ante sí, uno en pos de otro, y les preguntaron si habían hecho algún beneficio a los lacedemonios o a sus aliados en aquella guerra, y viendo que no respondían nada a esta pregunta, les mandaron salir del Senado y llevarles a otro lugar, donde todo fueron muertos, siendo de los de Platea más de doscientos, y de los atenienses que habían venido en su ayuda, más de veinticinco; sus mujeres las llevaron cautivas. La ciudad la entregaron a los megarenses, que habían sido lanzado de ella por las discordias y parcialidades que tenían, y a los otros plateenses que habían estado de parte de los lacedemonios, para que la habitasen todo juntos. Mas pasado el año la destruyeron y asolaron hasta los cimientos, y la reedificaron junto al templo de Juno, donde hicieron un albergue de dosciento pies de largo por todas partes, con todos sus aposentos arriba y abajo, y le adornaron con la clavazón, vigas, puertas y maderas de las casas que habían derribado, poniendo en él sus lechos y dormitorios, y dedicándole a la diosa Juno. Además le hicieron otro templo nuevo de piedra labrada, que tenía cien pies de largo. Todas las tierras del término de la ciudad de Platea la arrendaron por diez años para que las labrasen y cultivasen, parte de ellas a lo tebanos, y la mayor parte a los lacedemonios, los cuales las tomaron po agradar a los tebanos, pues, a causa de ellos, habían sido contrarios de lo plateenses, y también porque pensaban que los mismos tebanos les podían aprovechar mucho en la guerra contra los atenienses. Este fin tuvo la empresa y cerco de Platea, noventa y tres años después que los plateenses hicieron confederación y alianza con los atenienses. XI.

'But,' he said, 'the members of the Society have not yet understood your readiness for compromise. They are tenacious of their principles, and quite independent. I am hoping that they will accept you, but if they don't, you will An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org Page 422 not for a moment think that they are lacking in respect or love for you. They are hesitating to take any risk lest their high regard for you should be jeopardized. But whether you are formally admitted as a member or not, I am going to look upon you as one.' I informed Gokhale of my intentions. Whether I was admitted as a member or not, I wanted to have an Ashram where I could settle down with my Phoenix family, preferably somewhere in Gujarat, as, being a Gujarati, I thought I was best fitted to serve the country through serving Gujarat. Gokhale liked the idea. He said: 'You should certainly do so. Whatever may be the result of your talks with the members, you must look to me for the expenses of the Ashram, which I will regard as my own.' My heart overflowed with joy. It was a pleasure to feel free from the responsibility of raising funds, and to realize that I should not be obliged to set about the work all on my own, but that I should be able to count on a sure guide whenever I was in difficulty. This took a great load off my mind. So the late Dr. Dev was summoned and told to open an account for me in the Society's books and to give me whatever I might require for the Ashram and for public expenses. I now prepared to go to Shantiniketan. On the eve of my departure Gokhale arranged a party of selected friends, taking good care to order refreshments of my liking, i.e. , fruits and nuts. The party was held just a few paces from his room, and yet he was hardly in a condition to walk across and attend it. But his affection for me got the better of him and he insisted on coming. He came, but fainted and had to be carried away. Such fainting was not a new thing with him, and so when he came to, he sent word that we must go on with the party. This party was of course no more than a conversation in the open space opposite the Society's guest-house, during which friends had heart-to-heart chats over light refreshments of groundnuts, dates and fresh fruits of the season. But the fainting fit was to be no common event in my life. An Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org Page 423 3. WAS IT A THREAT? From Poona I went to Rajkot and Porbandar, where I had to meet my brother's widow and other relatives. During the Satyagraha in South Africa I had altered my style of dress so as to make it more in keeping with that of the indentured labourers, and in England also I had adhered to the same style for indoor use. For landing in Bombay I had a Kathiawadi suit of clothes consisting of a shirt, a dhoti, a cloak and a white scarf, all made of Indian mill cloth. But as I was to travel third from Bombay, I regarded the scarf and the cloak as too much of an incumbrance, so I shed them, and invested in an eight-to-ten-annas Kashmiri cap. One dressed in that fashion was sure to pass muster as a poor man. On account of the plague prevailing at that time, third class passengers were being medically inspected at Viramgam or Wadhwan – I forget which. I had slight fever. The inspector on finding that I had a temperature asked me to report myself to the Medical Officer at Rajkot and noted down my name. Someone had perhaps sent the information that I was passing through Wadhwan, for the tailor Motilal, a noted public worker of the place, met me at the station. He told me about the Viramgam customs, and the hardships railway passengers had to suffer on account of it. I had little inclination to talk because of my fever, and tried to finish with a brief reply which took the form of a question: 'Are you prepared to go to jail?' I had taken Motilal to be one of those impetuous youths who do not think before speaking. But not so Motilal. He replied with firm deliberation: 'We will certainly go to jail, provided you lead us. As Kathiawadis, we have the first right on you.","page_number":409,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 794, \"characters\": 4247}","created_at":"2025-07-27 08:33:45.574826+00"},{"id":"0041315e-1d31-40ff-ab9c-665fee78b3a9","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":670,"content":"O thou wicked Hannibal!

His keys, and the elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was still under his eye, struck me as peculiar. I followed him, and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard. This inner door Montgomery at once closed. A hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed window defended by an iron bar looked out towards the sea. This the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment; and the inner door, which “for fear of accidents,” he said, he would lock on the other side, was my limit inward. He called my attention to a convenient deck-chair before the window, and to an array of old books, chiefly, I found, surgical works and editions of the Latin and Greek classics (languages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the hammock. He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the inner one again. “We usually have our meals in here,” said Montgomery, and then, as if in doubt, went out after the other. “Moreau!” I heard him call, and for the moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness: Where had I heard the name of Moreau before? I sat down before the window, took out the biscuits that still remained to me, and ate them with an excellent appetite. Moreau! Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white, lugging a packing-case along the beach. Presently the window-frame hid him. Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me. After a little while I heard through the locked door the noise of the staghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach. They were not barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion. I could hear the rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery’s voice soothing them. I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau; but so odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that well-known name in its proper connection. From that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn, and when they did speak, endowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them? Then I recalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly attendant. Just as I was thinking of him he came in. He was now dressed in white, and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon. I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending amiably, and placed the tray before me on the table. Then astonishment paralysed me. Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear; it jumped upon me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed ears, covered with a fine brown fur! “Your breakfast, sair,” he said. I stared at his face without attempting to answer him. He turned and went towards the door, regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick of unconscious cerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase, “The Moreau Hollows”—was it? “The Moreau—” Ah! It sent my memory back ten years. “The Moreau Horrors!” The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment, and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver and creep. Then I remembered distinctly all about it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind. I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,— a prominent and masterful physiologist, well-known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness in discussion. Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing facts in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career was closed.","page_number":32,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 799, \"characters\": 4449}","created_at":"2025-08-19 14:37:35.474893+00"},{"id":"0043d5fd-9117-4b29-a133-eee6bd7b7eaa","book_id":"3efd081b-2eed-48b6-9fd1-9ecd9e881259","chunk_index":0,"content":"UNIVSRSITY Of CALIFORNIA tAN !ntaaii0ral Cbxtati0n EDITED BY WILLIAM T.

THE significance of Kousseau in education as well as in politics must be found in his revolutionary attitude toward established institutions. Some of his biographers relate the story that when the Academy of Dijon, in 1749, offered a prize for an essay on the question whether the progress of the arts and sciences has tended to the puri- fication of morals and manners, he followed the sugges- tion of Diderot, who reminded him of the greater noto- riety which he could gain by advocating the negative side. He accordingly wrote an essay denouncing civil- ized life in such eloquent terms that he became at once famous as a censor of civilization. He found this line of authorship so flattering to his conceit and so well fitted to his mode of life, his habits of thought, and lit- erary style, that he adopted it as a career, and attacked one after the other the existing foundations of civilization. The essay just named was published in 1750 ; that on the origin of inequality among men, in which he laid the axe to the root of the social system of Europe, in 1752 ; in 1762 he completed his raid against the political basis of government by his work on the social contract ; his Nou- velle Heloi'se appeared in 1760, sapping the ethics of the family relation ; his Emile, in 1762, uproots whatever is traditional in education and religion. Thus he attacks the four cardinal institutions of civilization the family, civil society, the state, and the Church together with the school, which is the means of conserving them. There have been many reformers, but none more radi- cal than Rousseau ; for he advocates the overthrow of civilization and the return to a state of nature. Nature is a word of many meanings. It may signify human nature as revealed in the institutions which man has founded. The nature of bees and ants appears in the social organizations that they form and in the prod- ucts of their united industry. So, too, human nature is revealed in the social unities of civilized life and in the works erected to continue them and secure them. But the word nature may signify physical nature as opposed to man it may stand for matter and brute force ; it may mean the untamed animal appetites that hold sway in human beings when not guided by moral or re- ligious principles. The opposite of civilization is savagery, and Voltaire wittily exposed the fallacy of the revolutionary appeal to Nature when he wrote to Eousseau acknowledging the gift of his essay on the origin of inequality among men : \" I have received your new book against the hu- man race, and I thank you for it. No one could paint in stronger colors the horrors of human society from which our ignorance and weakness promise themselves so many delights. Never has any one employed so much genius to make us into beasts. When one reads your book he is seized at once with a desire to go down on all- fours.\" The truth is, that this appeal to Nature is always a piece of jugglery.

But no one knows you are here.\" The Invisible Man swore. \"The secret's out. I gather it was a secret. I don't know what your plans are, but of course I'm anxious to help you.\" The Invisible Man sat down on the bed. \"There's breakfast upstairs,\" said Kemp, speaking as easily as possible, and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly. Kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere. \"Before we can do anything else,\" said Kemp, \"I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours.\" He had sat down, after one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has talking to do. His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where Griffin sat at the breakfast-table—a headless, handless dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette. \"It's simple enough—and credible enough,\" said Griffin, putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand. \"No doubt, to you, but—\" Kemp laughed. \"Well, yes; to me it seemed wonderful at first, no doubt. But now, great God! ... But we will do great things yet! I came on the stuff first at Chesilstowe.\" \"Chesilstowe?\" \"I went there after I left London. You know I dropped medicine and took up physics? No; well, I did. Light fascinated me.\" \"Ah!\" \"Optical density! The whole subject is a network of riddles—a network with solutions glimmering elusively through. And being but two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm, I said, 'I will devote my life to this. This is worth while.' You know what fools we are at two-and-twenty?\" \"Fools then or fools now,\" said Kemp. \"As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man! \"But I went to work—like a slave. And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly— blindingly! I found a general principle of pigments and refraction—a formula, a geometrical expression involving four dimensions. Fools, common men, even common mathematicians, do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics. In the books—the books that tramp has hidden—there are marvels, miracles! But this was not a method, it was an idea, that might lead to a method by which it would be possible, without changing any other property of matter—except, in some instances colours—to lower the refractive index of a substance, solid or liquid, to that of air—so far as all practical purposes are concerned.\" \"Phew!\" said Kemp. \"That's odd! But still I don't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal invisibility is a far cry.\" \"Precisely,\" said Griffin. \"But consider, visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether, because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air.","page_number":81,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 777, \"characters\": 4430}","created_at":"2025-07-19 09:23:36.569821+00"},{"id":"00448294-bf36-4c03-8710-97a9d44c05b2","book_id":"20fc8b3a-b897-4b74-a3cf-409554b843ce","chunk_index":31,"content":"YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. 1.F.3.

She had made the gesture unconsciously, but catch- ing the look in his eye a sudden thrill of anxiety ran through her. Recovering herself, however, and with THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG 285 an air of bright friendliness, she laid a hand upon the great arm-chair, above which hung the ancient sword of her ancestor, the comte Guilbert Mauprat de Chambery, and said : \" Sit here, Ranulph.\" Seating himself he gave a heavy sigh — one of those passing breaths of content which come to the hardest lives now and then : as though the Spirit of Life itself, in ironical apology for human existence, gives moments of respite from which hope is born again. Not for over four long years had Ranulph sat thus quietly in the presence of Guida. At first, when Maitresse Aimable had told him that Guida was leaving the Place du Vier Prison to live in this lonely place with her new-born child, he had gone to entreat her to remain , but Maitresse Aimable had been present then, and all that he could say — all that he might speak out of his friendship, out of the old love, now deep pity and sorrow — was of no avail. It had been borne in upon him then that she was not morbid, but that her mind had a sane, fixed purpose which she was intent to fulfil. It was as though she had made some strange covenant with a little helpless life, with a little face that was all her face ; and that covenant she would keep. So he had left her, and so to do her service had been granted elsewhere. The Chevalier, with perfect wisdom and nobility, insisted on being to Guida what he had always been, accepting what was as though it had always been, and speaking as naturally of her and the child as though there had always been a Guida and the child. Thus it was that he counted himself her protector, though he sat far away in the upper room of Elie Mattingley's house in. the Rue d'Egypte, thinking His own thoughts, biding the time when she should come back to the world, and mystery be over, and happiness come once more ; hoping only that he might live to see it. Under his direction , Jean Touzel had removed 286 THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG the few things that Guida took with her to Plemont and instructed by him, Elie Mattingley sold her furniture. Thus Guida had settled at Plemont, and there over four years of her life were passed. \" Your father — how is he ? \" she asked presently. \" Feeble,\" replied Ranulph ; \" he goes abroad but little now.\" \" It was said the Royal Court was to make him a gift, in remembrance of the Battle of Jersey.\" Ranulph turned his head away from her to the child, and beckoned him over. The child came instantly. As Ranulph lifted him on his knee he answered Guida: \" My father did not take it.\" \" Then they said you were to be conn<ftable — the grand monsieur ! \" She smiled at him in a friendly way. \" They said wrong,\" replied Ranulph. \" Most people would be glad of it,\" rejoined Guida. \" My mother used to say you would be Bailly one day.\" \" Who knows — perhaps I might have been ! \" She looked at him half sadly, half curiously. 'You — you haven't any ambitions now, maitre Ranulph ? \" It suddenly struck her that perhaps she was responsible for the maiming of this man's life — for clearly it was maimed. More than once she had thought of it, but it came home to her to-day with force. Years ago Ranulph Delagarde had been spoken of as one who might do great things, even to becoming Bailly. In the eyes of a Jerseyman to be Bailly was to be great, with jurats sitting in a row on either side of him and more important than any judge in the Kingdom. Looking back now Guida realised that Ranulph had never been the same since that day on the Ecrehos when his father had returned and Philip had told his wild tale of love. THE BATTLE OF THE STRONG 287 A great bitterness suddenly welled up in her. Without intention, without blame, she had brought suffering upon others.","page_number":281,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 779, \"characters\": 4082}","created_at":"2025-08-19 15:01:24.084659+00"},{"id":"004e8558-11eb-4bc2-bd2b-08de4ee31314","book_id":"0c8fa468-e87b-40dc-96a5-b084d53f0a33","chunk_index":55,"content":"An' nary a cent can the Hollys git now—an' maybe never.

I KNOW what that is, 'cause my Lady of the Roses has one; but we haven't got that—down here.\" Perry Larson sighed in exasperation. \"Gosh, if that ain't 'bout what I expected of ye! No, it ain't even second cousin to a—a-that thing you're a-talkin' of.

At the words a swift change came to David's face. His cheeks paled and his eyes dilated in terror. It was as if ahead of him he saw a yawning abyss, eager to engulf him. \"And you say—MONEY would—fix it?\" he asked thickly. \"Ex-ACT-ly!—a thousand o' them, though, 't would take.\" A dawning relief came into David's eyes—it was as if he saw a bridge across the abyss. \"You mean—that there wouldn't ANYTHING do, only silver pieces— like those?\" he questioned hopefully. \"Sugar, kid, 'course there would! Gosh, but you BE a checkerboard o' sense an' nonsense, an' no mistake! Any money would do the job—any money! Don't ye see? Anything that's money.\" \"Would g-gold do it?\" David's voice was very faint now. \"Sure!—gold, or silver, or greenbacks, or—or a check, if it had the dough behind it.\" David did not appear to hear the last. With an oddly strained look he had hung upon the man's first words; but at the end of the sentence he only murmured, \"Oh, thank you,\" and turned away. He was walking slowly now toward the house. His head was bowed. His step lagged. \"Now, ain't that jest like that chap,\" muttered the man, \"ter slink off like that as if he was a whipped cur. I'll bet two cents an' a doughnut, too, that in five minutes he'll be what he calls 'playin' it' on that 'ere fiddle o' his. An' I'll be derned, too, if I ain't curious ter see what he WILL make of it. It strikes me this ought ter fetch somethin' first cousin to a dirge!\" On the porch steps David paused a breathless instant. From the kitchen came the sound of Mrs. Holly's sobs and of a stern voice praying. With a shudder and a little choking cry the boy turned then and crept softly upstairs to his room. He played, too, as Perry Larson had wagered. But it was not the tragedy of the closed bank, nor the honor of the threatened farm-selling that fell from his violin. It was, instead, the swan song of a little pile of gold—gold which lay now in a chimney cupboard, but which was soon to be placed at the feet of the mourning man and woman downstairs. And in the song was the sob of a boy who sees his house of dreams burn to ashes; who sees his wonderful life and work out in the wide world turn to endless days of weed- pulling and dirt-digging in a narrow valley. There was in the song, too, something of the struggle, the fierce yea and nay of the conflict. But, at the end, there was the wild burst of exaltation of renunciation, so that the man in the barn door below fairly sprang to his feet with an angry:— \"Gosh! if he hain't turned the thing into a jig—durn him!","page_number":135,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 752, \"characters\": 4014}","created_at":"2025-08-20 04:03:37.43421+00"},{"id":"0054c002-ca36-46bf-bed3-be40580c6444","book_id":"e7136465-866b-497b-a798-7501ecaa2655","chunk_index":35,"content":"How can they be made to go as gladly to Bulwer Lytton as they go to the Henty books?” By means of story- telling. Give them an idea of the plots of the masters of literature, enough to whet the desire to know more about them. It is not sufficient just to tell the story, because it was not the plots of these writers that made them great artists. It was their manner of handling their plots, their delineation of character, the philosophy and human wisdom they put into the mouths of their heroes, and the boy or girl who does not become acquainted with these great creators during school days is likely never to know them, because he forms a taste for reading of a more ephemeral nature, and he may go through life a devourer of books, yet be only half educated. Why is it that so many young people never look at the English classics after they leave high school, and would rather spend a morning at hard labor than in reading As You Like It or A Midsummer Night’s Dream ? Because too much attention was given to the dissecting process when they studied these plays. Instead of being taught to see the beautiful and finished creation of some master, they were made to see the skeleton and to pull it to pieces. Some teachers assign a certain number of pages or paragraphs or stanzas for a lesson, and the pupils look up the words in the dictionary, point out the figures of speech, and scan the lines. Sometimes the teacher reads the assignment when it is made. Sometimes children dramatize it after they have torn it into shreds, or write a paraphrase. But the heart and soul of the masterpiece, the sheer beauty of it, are considered least of all, and students end by heartily hating something that they might have enjoyed and loved. Yet people wonder why the average American has so little appreciation of good literature, and think something is wrong with young folk who, after a high-school course in English, will read nothing but popular novels. There is nothing whatsoever the matter with the boys and girls. They simply follow the bent of all human beings and steer from the unpleasant toward the pleasant. They go to the books of the day that they can understand, because much of our great literature, presented as it is, means nothing to them. Less fortunate than youths of fifty years ago, they are not forced to read good books if they read at all. There are verdant, if less beautiful, meadows on every side where they may browse, and into them they go. It is infinitely better that a child’s school life provide him with a capacity for the enjoyment of literature than that he have a technical knowledge of a few pieces of literature, because the latter endows him with a narrow, academic viewpoint, while the former makes possible a future growth, without a capacity for which life must be narrow and one-sided. A boy or girl may know that Shakespeare wrote Twelfth Night or Macbeth , that Milton created “The Hymn to the Nativity” or Shelley “The Skylark,” be able to paraphrase each and analyze the sentences that comprise them, and not be a bit better fitted for life than he would be without that knowledge. But he is better equipped for life if he has acquired a capacity for the enjoyment of literature, so that to read a great book gives him pleasure or causes him to respond with sympathy, and the English teacher who does not develop this capacity in children has failed in his function. The approach to the great field of literature must be through specific examples, just as the approach to an understanding of art or architecture must be through the canvases of Raphael, Cimabue, or Giotto, or the temples that were the triumphs of Egyptian, Babylonian, or Hellenic builders. But if they are to be enjoyed, acquaintance with these specific examples must be made in a pleasurable manner. They first must be beheld in a perspective that gives glimpses of them as complete and beautiful wholes, and not through the detailed workmanship of architrave or abacus or by focusing the attention on the massing of figures according to square or triangular outline. And just as the understanding and enjoyment of one great structure or painting give added interest to every other one, so, in the realm of literature, each masterpiece enjoyed gives capacity for the enjoyment of every other masterpiece met with in the future.","page_number":65,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 768, \"characters\": 4344}","created_at":"2025-07-12 19:52:47.735794+00"},{"id":"0054d120-f787-405b-acad-3d04631be26c","book_id":"636f8908-0709-4de5-830c-78a4ccbb0dea","chunk_index":4,"content":"Then suddenly rising, he resumed his walk backwards and forwards, while his eyes shone with a pure light as though a noble and generous project burned within his breast.

The girls were left looking after them. \"We've got to find these clothes,\" said Mabel, \"simply got to. I used to want to be a heroine.

And now we see Gerald, a small but quite determined figure, paddling along in the soft white dust of the sunny road, in the wake 234 THE ENCHANTED CASTLE of two elderly gentlemen. His hand, in his trousers pocket, buries itself with a feeling of satisfaction in the heavy mixed coinage that is his share of the profits of his conjuring at the fair. His noiseless tennis-shoes bear him to the station, where, unobserved, he listens at the ticket office to the voice of That-which- was-James. \" One first London,\" it says ; and Gerald, waiting till That and the Ugly-Wugly have strolled on to the platform, politely con- versing of politics and the Kaffir market, takes a third return to London. The train strides in, squeaking and puffing. The watched take their seats in a carriage blue-lined. The watcher springs into a yellow wooden compartment. A whistle sounds, a flag is waved. The train pulls itself together, strains, jerks, and starts. \" I don't understand,\" says Gerald, alone in his third-class carriage, \" how railway trains and magic can go on at the same time.\" And yet they do. ***** Mabel and Kathleen, nervously peering among the rhododendron bashes and the bracken and the fancy fir-trees, find six several heaps of coats, hats, skirts, gloves, golf -clubs, hockey- sticks, broom-handles. They carry them, panting and damp, for the mid-day sun is pitiless, up the hill to where the stone dino- saurus looms immense among a forest of larches. The dinosaurus has a hole in his stomach. Kathleen shows Mabel how to \" make 236 THE ENCHANTED CASTLE a back \" and climbs up on it into the cold, stony inside of the monster. Mabel hands up the clothes and the sticks. \" There's lots of room,\" says Kathleen ; \" its tail goes down into the ground. It's like a secret passage.\" \" Suppose something comes out of it and jumps out at you,\" says Mabel, and Kathleen hurriedly descends. The explanations to Mademoiselle promise to be difficult, but, as Kathleen said afterwards, any little thing is enough to take a grown-up's attention off. A figure passes the window just as they are explaining that it really did look exactly like an uncle that the boys have gone to London with. \"Who's that?\" says Mademoiselle suddenly, pointing, too, which every one knows is not manners. It is the bailiff coming back from the doctor's with antiseptic plaster on that nasty cut that took so long a-bathing this morning. They tell her it is the bailiff at Yalding Towers, and she says, \"Sky!\" {del!) and asks no more awkward questions about the boys. Lunch — very late — is a silent meal. After lunch Mademoiselle goes out, in a hat with many pink roses, carrying a rose-lined parasol. The girls, in dead silence, organise a dolls' tea-party, with real tea.

The fire was made of coal, which must exist here somewhere. It was highly bitu- minous, and burned with a great blaze. The day was now drawing to a close ; far away I could see the lurid glow of the volcanoes, which grew brighter as the day declined : above, the skies twinkled with innumerable stars, and the air was filled with the moan of rushing waters. We entered the cave. As we did so the natives heaped coal upon the fire, and the flames arose, light- ing up the interior. We found here a number of women and children, who looked at us without either fear or curiosity. The children looked like little dwarfs ; the women were hags, hideous beyond description. One old woman in particular, who seemed to be in authority, was actually terrible in her awful and repulsive ugli- ness. A nightmare dream never furnished forth a more frightful object. This nightmare hag prostrated her- self before each of us with such an air of self-immola- tion that she looked as though she wished us to kill her at once. The rough cave, the red light of the fire, all made the scene more awful ; and a wild thought came to me that we had actually reached, while yet living, the infernal world, and that this was the abode of dev- ils. Yet their actions, it must be confessed, were far from devilish. Every one seemed eager to serve us. Some spread out couches formed of the skins of birds for us to sit on ; others attended to the fire ; others offered us gifts of large and beautiful feathers, together with numerous trinkets of rare and curious workman- ship. This kind attention on their part was a great puzzle to me, and I could not help suspecting that be- Found in a Copper Cylinder. 37 ncath all this there must be some sinister design.

The favourable manner in which this little piece has been received by the public, calls upon the author to explain the grounds on which he composed it. But before he opens those motives, it is fit that he should ask par¬ don of his readers for having of¬ fered his work to them under the borrowed personage of a trans- lator. As diffidence of his own abilities, and the novelty of the attempt , were his sole induce¬ ments to assume that disguise, he flatters himself he shall ap¬ pear excuseable . He resigned his performance to the impartial judg¬ ment of the public; determin¬ ed to let it perish in obscurity, if disapproved; nor meaning to avow such a trifle, unless better judges should pronounce that he might own it without a blush. It was an attempt to blend the. two kinds of Romance, the an¬ cient and the modern. In the for¬ mer, all was imagination and im¬ probability: in the latter, nature is always intended to be, and so¬ metimes has been, copied with XVII success. Invention has not been wanting; but the great resources of fancy have been dammed up, by a strict adherence to common life. But if in the latter species Nature has cramped imagination, she did but take her revenge, ha¬ ving been totally excluded from old Romances. The actions, sen¬ timents , conversations , of the heroes and heroines of ancient days were as unnatural as the machines employed to put them in motion. The author of the following pages thought it possible to re¬ concile the two kinds.Desirous of leaving the powers of fancy at liberty to expatiate through the boundless realms of invention , X V I I I and thence of creating more in¬ teresting situations , he wished to conduct the mortal agents in his drama according to the rules of probability; in short, to make them think, speak and act, as it might be supposed mere men and women would do in extraordina¬ ry positions. He had observed, that in all inspired writings, the personages under the dispensa¬ tion of miracles and witnesses to the most stupendous phenomena, never lose sight of their human character: whereas in the pro¬ ductions of romantic story , an improbable event never fails to be attended by an absurd dialo¬ gue. The actors seem to lose their senses, the moment the laws of X I X Nature have lost their tone. As the public have applauded the at¬ tempt , the author must not say he was entirely unequal to the task he had undertaken: yet if the new rout he has struck out shall have paved a road for men of brighter talents, he shall own with pleasure and modesty, that he was sensible the plan was ca¬ pable of receiving greater embel¬ lishments than his imagination or conduct of the passions could bestow on it. With regard to the deportment of the domestics, on which I have touched in the former preface, I will beg leave to add a few words. The simplicity of their behaviour, almost tending to excite smiles, X X which at first seem not consonant to the serious cast of the work, appeared to me not only not im¬ proper, but was marked designed¬ ly in that manner. My rule was Nature. However grave, impor¬ tant , or even melancholy, the sensations of Princes and heroes may be, they de not stamp the same affections on their domes¬ tics : at least the latter do not, or should not be made to express their passions in the same digni¬ fied tone. In my humble opinion, the contrast between the sublime of the one and the naivete of the other, sets the pathetic of the former in a stronger light. The very impatience which a reader feels, while delayed by the coar- X X I se pleasantries of vulgar actors from arriving at the knowledge of the important catastrophe he expects, perhaps heightens, cer¬ tainly proves, that he has been artfully interested in the depend¬ ing event. But I had higher au¬ thority than my own opinion for this conduct. That great master of nature, Shakespeare, was the model I copied. Let me ask if his tragedies of Hamlet and Julius Caesar would not lose a conside¬ rable share of their spirit and wonderful beauties, if the hu¬ mour of the grave-diggers, the fooleries of Polonius , and the clumsy jests of the Roman citi¬ zens were omitted, or vested in heroics ?","page_number":27,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 799, \"characters\": 4408}","created_at":"2025-09-06 16:02:56.614155+00"},{"id":"00590575-025d-47dd-8c20-64460104495a","book_id":"761b6b23-efff-4be3-b83b-e94a1bf0a81f","chunk_index":185,"content":"Some of those who question the miracle also question the theory of atonement; they assert that it does not accord with their idea of justice for one to die for all. Let each one bear his own sins and the punishments due for them, they say. The doctrine of vicarious suffering is not a new one; it is as old as the race. That one should suffer for others is one of the most familiar of principles and we see the principle illustrated every day of our lives. Take the family, for instance; from the day the mother's first child is bom, for twenty or thirty years her children are scarcely out of her waking thoughts. Her life trembles in the balance at each child's birth; she sacrifices for them, she sur- renders herself to them. Is it because she expects them to pay her back? Fortunate for the parent and fortunate for the child if the latter has an opportunity to repay in part the debt it owes. But no child can compensate a parent for a parent's care. In the course of nature the debt is paid, not to the parent, but to the next generation, and the next — each generation suffering, sacrificing for and surrendering itself to the generation that fol- lows. This is the law of our lives. Nor is this confined to the family. Every step in civilization 456 THE ART OF PUBLIC SPEAKING has been made possible by those who have been willing to sacri- fice for posterity. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free- dom of conscience and free government have all been won for the world by those who were willing to labor unselfishly for their fellows. So well established is this doctrine that we do not regard anyone as great unless he recognizes how unimportant his life is in comparison with the problems with which he deals. I find proof that man was made in the image of his Creator in the fact that, throughout the centuries, man has been willing to die, if necessary, that blessings denied to him might be enjoyed by his children, his children's children and the world. The seeming paradox: \"He that saveth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it,\" has an appli- cation wider than that usually given to it; it is an epitome of history. Those who live only for themselves live little lives, but those who stand ready to give themselves for the advancement of things greater than themselves find a larger life than the one they would have surrendered. Wendell Philips gave expression to the same idea when he said, \"What imprudent men the bene- factors of the race have been. How prudently most men sink into nameless graves, while now and then a few forget themselves into immortality.\" We win immortality, not by remembering ourselves, but by forgetting ourselves in devotion to things larger than ourselves. Instead of being an unnatural plan, the plan of salvation is in Eerfect harmony with human nature as we understand it. Sacri- ce is the language of love, and Christ, in suffering for the world, adopted the only means of reaching the heart. This can be demonstrated not only by theory but by experience, for the story of His life. His teachings, His sufferings and His death has been translated into every language and everywhere it has touched the heart. But if I were going to present an argument in favor of the divinity of Christ, I would not begin with miracles or mystery or with the theory of atonement. I would begin as Carnegie Simpson does in his book entitled, \"The Fact of Christ.\" Com- mencing with the undisputed fact that Christ lived, he points out that one cannot contemplate this fact without feeling that in some way it is related to those now living. He says that one can read of Alexander, of Caesar or of Napoleon, and not feel that it is a matter of personal concern; but that when one reads that Christ lived, and how He lived and how He died, he feels that somehow there is a cord that stretches from that life to his. As he studies the character of Christ he becomes conscious of cer- tain virtues which stand out in bold relief — His purity, His for- giving spirit, and His unfathomable love. The author is correct. Christ presents an example of purity in thought and life, and man, conscious of his own imperfections and grieved over his APPENDICES 457 shortcomings, finds inspiration in the fact that He was tempted in all points like as we are, and yet without sin.","page_number":458,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 787, \"characters\": 4350}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:22:21.331823+00"},{"id":"005b0bf5-780a-4097-bac7-ee448b617abb","book_id":"030f26f3-eb75-429d-a533-da19de421728","chunk_index":18,"content":"I'm food for your betters.

A little while more, and swish, swish, swish, the Lion himself came stalking slowly along, whisking away the flies with his tail. When he saw the Goat sitting beside his den, says he— \"Friend Goat, what want you here? Are you anxious to make a meal for me?\" \"O King Lion,\" said the Goat, bowing before him very humbly, \"here I have been sitting these two hours, and wolves and jackals came to eat me; but the sight of your footprints was safety for me: I told them I was yours, and they took to their heels for fear. Now eat me if you will; for yours I am.\" Then the Lion said, \"O Goat, if you have called yourself mine, never will I devour you. I will see to it that you are well treated.\" Then the Lion went out and found an Elephant, who greeted him with the greatest respect. \"Elephant,\" said the Lion, \"I want you to do something for me.\" \"Speak on,\" said the Elephant, \"do it I will.\" The Lion said, \"There is a poor lame Goat has thrown himself on my mercy, and I have thought of a plan by which he can be fed. If you will suffer him to mount on your back, then while you go grazing about, he can browse upon the young shoots of the trees as you pass under.\" \"That is a good idea,\" said the Elephant, \"and I'll do it for you willingly, and indeed anything else in my power.\" If the Lion was pleased at the kindness of the Elephant, more pleased was the lame Goat; and a happy life was his from that day. Never again was he beaten by a cruel goatherd: but he fed on the fat of the land, and lived to a green old age; and I hope we may be half as happy as he was. The Cat and the Sparrows [Notes] T HERE was once a pair of Sparrows that lived in a tree. They used to hop about all over the place, picking up seeds or anything they could find to eat. One day, when they came back with their pickings, the Cock had found some rice, and the Hen a few lentils. They put it all in an earthen pot, and then proceeded to cook their dinner. Then they divided the mess into two equal parts. The Cock was rather greedy, so he would not wait while his wife put out the fire and got ready to join in the meal. No! he gobbled up his share at once, before she could begin. When at last the poor Hen came up, her greedy mate would not let her rest even then. \"Go and get me a drink of water,\" said he quite rudely. She was a very kind wife, so without taking any notice of his rudeness, off she went for the water. While she was gone the Cock-sparrow's eyes fell on his wife's share of the dinner. \"Ah,\" thought he, \"how I should like another bit! Well, why shouldn't I have it? A man does all the work, and women don't want much to eat at any time.\" So without any more ado, he just set to, and gobbled up his wife's share. Back came the Hen-sparrow with a drink of water for her husband. When he had drunk it up (and I am afraid he forgot to say thank you), she turned round to look for her dinner. Lo and behold! there was none. What could have become of it? As she was wondering, she happened to look at her husband; he looked so guilty that there could be no manner of doubt where her dinner was. \"You greedy bird,\" said she, \"why have you eaten my dinner?\" \"I haven't touched your dinner,\" said the Cock angrily. \"I'm sure you have,\" said she, \"or you would not look so guilty. Why, you are actually blushing.\" And so indeed he was; the tip of his beak was quite red. However, he still denied it, and grew angrier and angrier, as people do when they know they are in the wrong. They had a terrible quarrel. At last the Hen- sparrow said, \"Well, I know a way to find out whether you are telling lies or not. You come along with me.\" And she made him go with her to the well.","page_number":55,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 800, \"characters\": 4004}","created_at":"2025-10-28 04:15:17.854138+00"},{"id":"005f0ba1-d225-4b0d-ad3d-78dbdda87871","book_id":"8b4eba24-a6ae-4a7c-a6f4-42ddd86997f5","chunk_index":23,"content":"He did it, and crack went the branch, splash went the poor chicks into the water, and all were drowned but Cocky, who flew across and was saved. Poor little Hop, Chirp, and Downy went floating down the brook like balls of white foam, and were never seen again. All the hens mourned for them, and put a black feather in their heads to show how sorry they were. Mamma Partlet was heart-broken to lose three darlings at once; but Cocky comforted her, and never told how it happened, because he was ashamed to have people know what a bad bird Peck was. A butterfly saw it all, and he told Granny Cockletop about it; and the hens were so angry that they turned Peck out of the barnyard, and he had to go and live in the woods alone. He said he didn’t care; but he did, and was very unhappy, and used to go and peep into the pleasant field where the fowls scratched and talked together. He dared not show himself, for they would have driven him out. But kind Cocky saw him, and would run with some nice bit and creep through the fence into the wood, saying,-- 30 “Poor brother, I’m sorry for you, and I’ll come and play with you, and tell you the news.” Now in this wood lived a fox, and he had been planning to eat Peck as soon as he was fat; for he missed the good corn and meal he used to have, and grew very thin living on grasshoppers and berries. While he waited the sly fellow made friends with Peck, though the bird knew that foxes ate hens. “I’m not afraid, and I don’t believe old Granny Cockletop’s tales. I can take care of myself, I guess,” he said, and went on playing with the fox, who got him to tell all about the hen- house,--how the door was fastened, and where the plump chickens roosted, and what time they went to bed,--so that he could creep in and steal a good supper by and by. Silly Peck never guessed what harm he was doing, and only laughed when Cocky said,-- “You will be sorry if you play with the fox. He is a bad fellow; so be careful and sleep on a high branch, and keep out of his way, as I do.” Cocky was fat and large, and the fox longed to eat him, but never could, because he wisely ran home whenever he saw the rogue hiding in the wood. This made Peck angry, for he wanted his brother to stay and play; and so one day, when Cocky ran off in the midst of a nice game, Peck said to the fox,-- “See here, if you want to catch that fellow, I’ll tell you how to do it. He has promised to bring me some food to-night, when all the rest are at roost. He will hide and not get shut up; then, when those cross old biddies are asleep, he will cluck softly, and I am to go in and eat all I want out of the pan. You hide on the top of the hen-house; and while he talks to me, you can pounce on him. Then I shall be the only cock here, and they will have to make me king.” “All right,” said the fox, much pleased with the plan, and very glad that Peck had a chance to get fatter. So when it was night, Peck crept through the broken paling and waited till he heard the signal. Now, good Cocky had saved up nice bits from his own dinner, and put them in a paper hidden under a bush. He spread them all out in the barnyard and called; and Peck came in a great hurry to eat them, never stopping to say, “Thank you.” Cocky stood by talking pleasantly till a little shower came up. “Peck, dear, put this nice thick paper over you; then you will be dry, and can go on eating. I’ll step under that burdock leaf and wait till you are done,” said Cocky; and Peck was too busy gobbling up the food to remember anything else. Now the fox had just crept up on the hen-house roof; and when he peeped down, there was just light enough to see a white thing bobbing about. “Ah, ha! that’s Cockyloo; now for a good supper!” And with a jump he seized Peck by the head before he could explain the mistake.","page_number":33,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 758, \"characters\": 3806}","created_at":"2025-07-19 15:07:09.206655+00"},{"id":"006444ba-7d0d-4385-87c3-e0ee7ae21f58","book_id":"f032b518-ffa8-4d3a-af26-4b8a28dc4472","chunk_index":801,"content":"So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. 38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

He took a hoe and went out and sat down on a rock. But Columbus, as he sat 496 THE ART OF PUBLIC SPEAKING upon that shore and looked out upon the ocean, noticed that the ships, as they sailed away, sank deeper into the sea the farther they went. And since that time some other \"Spanish ships\" have sunk into the sea. But as Columbus noticed that the tops of the masts dropped down out of sight, he said: \"That is the way it is with this hoe handle; if you go around this hoe handle, the farther off you go the farther down you go. I can sail around to the East Indies.' How plain it all was. How simple the mind — majestic like the simplicity of a mountain in its greatness. Who are the great inventors? They are ever the simple, plain, everyday people who see the need and set about to supply it. I was once lecturing in North Carolina, and the cashier of the bank sat directly behind a lady who wore a very large hat. I said to that audience, \"Your wealth is too near to you; you are looking right over it.\" He whispered to his friend, \"Well, then, my wealth is in that hat.\" A little later, as he wrote me, I said, \"Wherever there is a human need there is a greater fortune than a mine can furnish.\" He caught my thought, and he drew up his plan for a better hat pin than was in the hat before him, and the pin is now being manufactured. He was offered fifty- five thou- sand dollars for his patent. That man made his fortune before he got out of that hall. This is the whole question: Do you see a need? I remember well a man up in my native hills, a poor man, who for twenty years was helped by the town in his poverty, who owned a wide-spreading maple tree that covered the poor man's cottage like a benediction from on high. I remember that tree, for in the spring — there were some roguish boys around that neighborhood when I was young — in the spring of the year the man would put a bucket there and the spouts to catch the maple sap, and I remember where that bucket was; and when I was young the boys were, oh, so mean, that they went to that tree before that man had gotten out of bed in the morning, and after he had gone to bed at night, and drank up that sweet sap. I could swear they did it. He didn't make a great deal of maple sugar from that tree. But one day he made the sugar so white and crystalline that the visitor did not believe it was maple sugar; thought maple sugar must be red or black. He said to the old man: \"Why don't you make it that way and sell it for confec- tionery?\" The old man caught his thought and invented the \"rock maple cr5rstal,\" and before that patent expired he had ninety thousand dollars and had built a beautiful palace on the site of that tree. After forty years owning that tree he awoke to find it had fortimes of money indeed in it. And many of us are right by the tree that has a fortune for us, and we own it, possess it, do what we will with it, but we do not learn its value because we do not see the human need, and in these discoveries and in- ventions this is one of the most romantic things of life. APPENDICES . 497 I have received letters from all over the country and from England, where I have lectured, saying that they have discovered this and that, and one man out in Ohio took me through his great factories last spring, and said that they cost him $680,000, and said he, \"I was not worth a cent in the worid when I heard your lecture 'Acres of Diamonds;' but I made up my mind to stop right here and make my fortune here, and here it is.\" He showed me through his unmortgaged possessions. And this is a continual experience now as I travel through the country, after these many years. I mention this incident, not to boast, but to show you that you can do the same if you will. Who are the great inventors? I remember a good illustration in a man who used to live in East Brookfield, Mass.","page_number":498,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 783, \"characters\": 3955}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:22:21.331823+00"},{"id":"0068407c-7cda-4750-b795-e8ffa9735d28","book_id":"be75a8b5-b47e-4515-9755-ba511d161773","chunk_index":20,"content":"It was as if they were a different order of beings!

Her little brother Harry , by some throw-back for all the world like a manikin Spaniard. And the smaller Thorntons: Edward , mouse-coloured, with a general mousy (but pleasing) expression: Rachel , with tight short gold curls and a fat pink face (John’s colouring watered down): and last of all Laura , a queer mite of three with heavy dark eyebrows, and blue eyes, a big head-top and a receding chin—as if the Procreative Spirit was getting a little hysterical by the time it reached her. A silver-age conception, Laura’s, decidedly. When the Norther blew itself out, it soon fell away almost dead calm. The morning they finally rounded Cape San Antonio was hot, blazing hot. But it is never stuffy at sea: there is only this disadvantage, that while on land a shady hat protects you from the sun, at sea nothing can protect you from that second sun which is mirrored upwards from the water, strikes under all defences, and burns the unseasoned skin from all your under-sides. Poor John! His throat and chin were a blistered red. From the point itself there is a whitish bank in two fathoms, bowed from north to north-east. The outer side is clean and steep-to, and in fine weather one can steer along it by eye. It ends in Black Key, a rock standing out of the water like a ship’s hull. Beyond that lies a channel, very foul and difficult to navigate: and beyond that again the Coloradoes Reef begins, the first of a long chain of reefs following the coast in a north-easterly direction as far as Honde Bay, two-thirds the way to Havana. Within the reefs lies the intricate Canal de Guaniguanico, of which this channel is the westernmost outlet, with its own rather dubious little ports. But ocean traffic, needless to say, shuns the whole box of tricks: and the Clorinda advisedly stood well away to the northward, keeping her course at a gentle amble for the open Atlantic. John was sitting outside the galley with the sailor called Curtis, who was instructing him in the neat mystery of a Turk’s-head. Young Henry Marpole was steering. Emily was messing around—not talking, just being by him. As for the other sailors, they were all congregated in a ring, up in the bows, so that one saw nothing but their backs. But every now and then a general guffaw, and a sudden surging of the whole group, showed they were up to something or other. John presently tiptoed forward, to see what it might be. He thrust his bullet-head among their legs, and worked his way in till he had as good a view as the earliest comer. He found they had got the old monkey, and were filling him up with rum. First they gave him biscuit soaked in it: then they dipped rags in a pannikin of the stuff, and squeezed them into his mouth. Then they tried to make him drink direct: but that he would not do—it only wasted a lot of spirit. John felt a vague horror at all this: though of course he did not guess the purpose behind it. The poor brute shivered and chattered, rolled his eyes, spluttered. I suppose it must have been an excruciatingly funny sight. Every now and then he would seem altogether overcome by the spirit. Then one of them would lay him on the top of an old beef barrel—but hey presto, he would be up like lightning, trying to streak through the air over their heads. But he was no bird: they caught him each time, and set to work to dope him again. As for John, he could no more have left the scene now than Jacko the monkey could. It was astonishing what a lot of spirit the wizened little brute could absorb. He was drunk, of course: hopelessly, blindly, madly drunk. But he was not paralytic, not even somnolent: and it seemed as if nothing could overcome him. So at last they gave up the attempt.","page_number":25,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 799, \"characters\": 4496}","created_at":"2025-07-27 08:45:17.233174+00"},{"id":"00686568-ff4d-43d9-8808-b5975bd395f0","book_id":"18ea9273-eacb-48f0-a5dd-11a5ac6724e5","chunk_index":43,"content":"Nie werde ich es vergessen, liebenswürdige Prinzessin, daß ich aus deinem Becher getrunken und darin ein Leben gefunden habe, auf das ich keine Hoffnung mehr gehabt hätte, wenn du noch länger bei deiner Grausamkeit beharrt.« Prinzessin Bedrulbudur führte nun den Becher an den Mund, berührte ihn aber nur mit den Lippen, indes der afrikanische Zauberer sich sehr bemühte, es ihr zuvor zu tun, und den seinigen ausleerte, ohne einen Tropfen darin zu lassen. Die Prinzessin sah, daß seine Augen sich verdrehten und er ohne Bewußtsein rücklings zusammensank. Nun kam Alaeddin herauf und trat in den Saal. Als er den afrikanischen Zauberer auf dem Sofa ausgestreckt liegen sah, und die Prinzessin Bedrulbudur ihm voll Freude und mit offenen Armen entgegeneilte, hielt er sie zurück und sagte: »Es ist noch nicht Zeit, Prinzessin; tu mir den Gefallen, begib dich auf dein Zimmer und sorge dafür, daß man mich allein läßt, indes ich meine Vorbereitungen treffe, die dich ebenso schnell nach China wieder zurückbringen, wie du von da entfernt worden bist.« Sobald die Prinzessin mit ihren Frauen und Verschnittenen aus dem Saale gegangen war, verschloß Alaeddin die Türe, näherte sich dem Leichnam des afrikanischen Zauberers, öffnete sein Kleid und zog die Lampe heraus. Er enthüllte sie und rieb daran und alsbald erschien auch der Geist mit seinem gewöhnlichen Gruß. »Geist,« sagte Alaeddin zu ihm, »ich habe dich gerufen, um dir im Namen der Lampe, deiner guten Gebieterin, die du hier siehst, zu befehlen, daß du diesen Palast wieder nach China zurücktragen lässest, und zwar an denselben Ort und dieselbe Stelle, von wo er weggenommen ist.« Der Geist gab durch ein Kopfnicken zu verstehen, daß er gehorchen werde und verschwand. Die Versetzung ging wirklich vor sich, und man spürte sie nur an zwei sehr leichten Erschütterungen: die eine, als der Palast von seiner Stelle in Afrika emporgehoben, und die andere, als er in China gegenüber dem Palast des Sultans niedergelassen wurde, was alles in wenigen Augenblicken geschehen war. Alaeddin ging nun ins Zimmer der Prinzessin hinab, umarmte sie und sagte zu ihr: »Prinzessin, ich kann dich versichern, daß deine und meine Freude morgen früh vollkommen sein wird.« Da die Prinzessin ihre Abendmahlzeit noch nicht vollendet hatte und Alaeddin zu essen verlangte, so ließ sie aus dem Saal mit den vierundzwanzig Fenstern die Speisen, die dort aufgetragen, aber kaum berührt worden waren, auf ihr Zimmer bringen. Die Prinzessin und Alaeddin speisten zusammen und tranken von dem guten alten Wein des afrikanischen Zauberers. Ich will nichts von ihrer weiteren Unterhaltung sagen, die nur sehr vergnügt sein konnte, und füge bloß hinzu, daß sie sich zuletzt miteinander in ihr Schlafgemach begaben. Seit der Entführung des Palastes und der Prinzessin Bedrulbudur war der Sultan, der Vater dieser Prinzessin, untröstlich, weil er sie für immer verloren glaubte. Er konnte weder bei Nacht noch bei Tag Ruhe finden, und statt alles zu vermeiden, was seinem Kummer neue Nahrung geben konnte, suchte er es im Gegenteil absichtlich auf. Während er zum Beispiel vorher nur morgens nach dem offenen Erker seines Palastes gegangen war, um seine Augen an dem angenehmen Anblick zu weiden, dessen er nicht satt werden konnte, so ging er jetzt mehrere Male des Tags hinauf, um seinen Tränen freien Lauf zu lassen und sich immer tiefer in seine Betrübnis zu versenken durch den Gedanken, daß er das, was ihm so wohlgefallen hatte, nie wieder sehen werde, und das Liebste, das er auf der Welt besessen, auf immer verloren habe. Auch an dem Morgen, als Alaeddins Palast wieder an seinen alten Platz gebracht worden war, hatte sich die Morgenröte kaum am Himmel gezeigt, als der Sultan wieder in den Erker ging. Er war so in sich gekehrt und so durchdrungen von seinem Schmerz, daß er seine Augen traurig nach der Seite hinwendete, wo er nur den leeren Raum und keinen Palast mehr zu erblicken vermeinte. Als er nun auf einmal diese Leere ausgefüllt sah, hielt er es für einen Nebel. Endlich aber, nachdem er es aufmerksamer betrachtet hatte, erkannte er, daß es unzweifelhaft Alaeddins Palast war. Freude und Fröhlichkeit bemächtigten sich jetzt seines Herzens nach langem Kummer und Gram. Er kehrte eilig auf sein Zimmer zurück und befahl, man solle ihm ein Pferd satteln und vorführen. Er schwang sich hinauf, ritt fort und es war ihm, als könne er nicht schnell genug bei Alaeddins Palast anlangen. Alaeddin, der dies vorausgesehen hatte, war mit Tagesanbruch aufgestanden, hatte eines seiner prächtigsten Kleider angelegt und sich sodann in den Saal mit den vierundzwanzig Fenstern begeben, von wo aus er den Sultan kommen sah.","page_number":72,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 750, \"characters\": 4663}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:46:18.050891+00"},{"id":"006ee42a-ecbd-4721-bfe5-0ab450e8d744","book_id":"d7c36d74-82f7-4e7b-8021-67e2d8098fdc","chunk_index":84,"content":"It was a gigantic head of Satan. Towards the close of Chantrey’s life, a friend passing through his studio was struck by this model lying in a corner. “That head,” said the sculptor, “was the first thing that I did after I came to London. I worked at it in a garret with a paper cap on my head; and as I could then afford only one candle, I stuck that one in my cap that it might move along with me, and give me light whichever way I turned.” Flaxman saw and admired this head at the Academy Exhibition, and recommended Chantrey for the execution of the busts of four admirals, required for the Naval Asylum at Greenwich. This commission led to others, and painting was given up. But for eight years before, he had not earned 5 l. by his modelling. His famous head of Horne Tooke was such a success that, according to his own account, it brought him commissions amounting to 12,000 l. Chantrey had now succeeded, but he had worked hard, and fairly earned his good fortune. He was selected from amongst sixteen competitors to execute the statue of George III. for the city of London. A few years later, he produced the exquisite monument of the Sleeping Children, now in Lichfield Cathedral,—a work of great tenderness and beauty; and thenceforward his career was one of increasing honour, fame, and prosperity. His patience, industry, and steady perseverance were the means by which he achieved his greatness. Nature endowed him with genius, and his sound sense enabled him to employ the precious gift as a blessing. He was prudent and shrewd, like the men amongst whom he was born; the pocket-book which accompanied him on his Italian tour containing mingled notes on art, records of daily expenses, and the current prices of marble. His tastes were simple, and he made his finest subjects great by the mere force of simplicity. His statue of Watt, in Handsworth church, seems to us the very consummation of art; yet it is perfectly artless and simple. His generosity to brother artists in need was splendid, but quiet and unostentatious. He left the principal part of his fortune to the Royal Academy for the promotion of British art. The same honest and persistent industry was throughout distinctive of the career of David Wilkie. The son of a Scotch minister, he gave early indications of an artistic turn; and though he was a negligent and inapt scholar, he was a sedulous drawer of faces and figures. A silent boy, he already displayed that quiet concentrated energy of character which distinguished him through life. He was always on the look-out for an opportunity to draw,—and the walls of the manse, or the smooth sand by the river side, were alike convenient for his purpose. Any sort of tool would serve him; like Giotto, he found a pencil in a burnt stick, a prepared canvas in any smooth stone, and the subject for a picture in every ragged mendicant he met. When he visited a house, he generally left his mark on the walls as an indication of his presence, sometimes to the disgust of cleanly housewives. In short, notwithstanding the aversion of his father, the minister, to the “sinful” profession of painting, Wilkie’s strong propensity was not to be thwarted, and he became an artist, working his way manfully up the steep of difficulty. Though rejected on his first application as a candidate for admission to the Scottish Academy, at Edinburgh, on account of the rudeness and inaccuracy of his introductory specimens, he persevered in producing better, until he was admitted. But his progress was slow. He applied himself diligently to the drawing of the human figure, and held on with the determination to succeed, as if with a resolute confidence in the result. He displayed none of the eccentric humour and fitful application of many youths who conceive themselves geniuses, but kept up the routine of steady application to such an extent that he himself was afterwards accustomed to attribute his success to his dogged perseverance rather than to any higher innate power. “The single element,” he said, “in all the progressive movements of my pencil was persevering industry.” At Edinburgh he gained a few premiums, thought of turning his attention to portrait painting, with a view to its higher and more certain remuneration, but eventually went boldly into the line in which he earned his fame,—and painted his Pitlessie Fair. What was bolder still, he determined to proceed to London, on account of its presenting so much wider a field for study and work; and the poor Scotch lad arrived in town, and painted his Village Politicians while living in a humble lodging on eighteen shillings a week.","page_number":140,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 797, \"characters\": 4627}","created_at":"2025-10-27 16:54:20.894607+00"},{"id":"00734b83-da98-48d1-a023-17732b6b1693","book_id":"77af11ff-e6d9-4e49-a29b-d46b300973b7","chunk_index":55,"content":"Billings, having arrived at a decision, lost no time in acting, with the result that before mid-afternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked “‘ H”’ upon the beach, and were busily engaged in opening them. Two days later the plane was assembled and tuned. We loaded tackles and ropes, water, food and ammu- nition in it, and then we each implored Billings to let us be the one to accompany him. But he would take no one. That was Billings; if there was any especially difficult or dangerous work to be done, that one man could do, Billings always did it himself. If he needed assistance, he never called for volunteers — just selected the man or men he considered best quali- fied for the duty. THe said that he considered the principles underlying: all volunteer service funda- mentally wrong, and that it seemed. to him that call- ing for volunteers reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire command, We rolled the plane down to the water’s edge, and Billings mounted the pilct’s seat. There was a mo- ment’s delay as he assured himself that he had every- thing necessary. Jimmy Hollis went over his arma- ment and ammunition to see that nothing had been 151 THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT omitted. Besides pistol and rifle, there was the ma- chine-gun mounted in front of him on the plane, and ammunition for all three. Bowen’s account of the terrors of Caspak had impressed us all with the ne- cessity for proper means of defense. At last all was ready. The motor was started, and we pushed the plane out into the surf. A moment later, and she was skimming seaward. Gently she rose from the surface of the water, executed a wide spiral as she mounted rapidly, circled once far above us and then disappeared over the crest of the cliffs. We all stood silent and expectant, our eyes glued upon the towering summit above us. Hollis, who was now in command, consulted his wrist-watch at frequent intervals. “Gad,” exclaimed Short, “we ought to be hear- ing from him pretty soon!” Hollis laughed nervously. “ He’s been gone only ten minutes,” he announced. “Seems like an hour,” snapped Short. ‘‘ What’s that? Did you hear that? He’s firing! It’s the ma- chine-gun! Oh, Lord; and here we are as helpless as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away! We can’t do a thing. We don’t know what’s happening. Why didn’t he let one of us go with him?” Yes, it was the machine-gun. We could hear it distinctly for at least a minute. Then came silence. That was two weeks ago. We have had no sign nor signal from Tom Billings since. 152 CHAPTER II |ee never forget my first impressions of Caspak as [ circled in, high over the surrounding cliffs. From the plane I looked down through a mist upon the blurred landscape beneath me. The hot, humid atmosphere of Caspak condenses as it is fanned by the cold Antarctic air-currents which sweep across the crater’s top, sending a tenuous ribbon of vapor far out across the Pacific. Through this the picture gave one the suggestion of a colossal impressionistic canvas in greens and browns and scarlets and yellows surrounding the deep blue of the inland sea — just blobs of color taking form through the tumbling mist, I dived close to the cliffs and skirted them for several miles without finding the least indication of a suitable landing-place; and then I swung back at a lower level, looking for a clearing close to the bottom of the mighty escarpment; but I could find none of sufficient area to insure safety. I was flying pretty low by this time, not only looking for landing places but watching the myriad life beneath me. I was down pretty well toward the south end of the island, where an arm of the lake reaches far inland, and I could see the surface of the water literally black with crea- tures of some sort. I was too far up to recognize individuals, but the general impression was of a vast army of amphibious monsters. The land was 153 j THE UAND THAT TIME FORGOT almost equally alive with crawling, leaping, running, flying things. It was one of the latter which nearly did for me while my attention was fixed upon the weird scene below. The first intimation I had of it was the sudden blotting out of the sunlight from above, and as I glanced quickly up, I saw a most terrific creature swooping down upon me.","page_number":146,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 771, \"characters\": 4277}","created_at":"2025-10-27 17:20:22.085921+00"},{"id":"00747b10-c3f6-4986-8ed8-e530f6425111","book_id":"9a7d2ebe-5a2e-4606-996a-e6e5d1f81762","chunk_index":46,"content":"If these consequences are unpleasing, are we to say that abso- lutely and in truth the good is the object of wish, but for each per- son the apparent good; that that which is in truth an object of wish is an object of wish to the good man, while any chance thing may be so to the bad man, as in the case of bodies also the things that are in truth wholesome are wholesome for bodies which are in good condition, while for those that are diseased other things are whole- some — or bitter or sweet or hot or heavy, and so on; since the good man judges each class of things rightly, and in each the truth appears to him? * For each state of character has its own ideas of the noble and the pleasant, and perhaps the good man di ff ers from others most by seeing the truth in each class of things, being as it were the norm and measure of them. * In most things the error seems 1 111 b 26 . the nicomachean ethics iii.4 5 10 15 20 25 30 46 to be due to pleasure; for this appears a good when it is not. We therefore choose the pleasant as a good and avoid pain as an evil. Virtue and vice are in our power 5. The end, then, being what we wish for, the means what we delib- erate about and choose, actions concerning means must be according to choice and voluntary. Now the exercise of the virtues is con- cerned with means. Therefore virtue also is in our own power, and so too vice. For where it is in our power to act it is also in our power not to act, and vice versa ; so that, if to act, where this is noble, is in our power, not to act, which will be base, will also be in our power, and if not to act, where this is noble, is in our power, to act, which will be base, will also be in our power. Now if it is in our power to do noble or base acts, and likewise in our power not to do them, and this was what being good or bad meant, then it is in our power to be virtuous or vicious. * The saying that ‘no one is voluntarily wicked nor involuntarily happy’ seems to be partly false and partly true; for no one is invol- untarily happy, but wickedness is voluntary. Or else we shall have to dispute what has just been said, at any rate, and deny that man is a moving principle or begetter of his actions, as of children. But if these facts are evident and we cannot refer actions to mov- ing principles other than those in ourselves, the acts whose moving principles are in us must themselves also be in our power and voluntary. * Witness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their private capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish and take vengeance on those who do wicked acts (unless they have acted under compulsion or as a result of ignorance for which they are not themselves responsible * ), while they honour those who do noble acts, as though they meant to encourage the latter and deter the former. But no one is encouraged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntary; it is assumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hot or in pain or hungry or the like, since we shall experience these feelings none the less. Indeed, we punish a man for his very ignorance, if he is thought responsible for the ignorance, as when penalties are doubled in the case of drunken- ness; * for the moving principle is in the man himself, since he had the power of not getting drunk and his getting drunk was the cause 1113 b 5 10 15 20 25 30 the nicomachean ethics iii.5 47 of his ignorance. And we punish those who are ignorant of anything in the laws that they ought to know and that is not di ffi cult, and so too in the case of anything else that they are thought to be ignorant of through carelessness; we assume that it is in their power not to be ignorant, since they have the power of taking care. * But perhaps a man is the kind of man not to take care.","page_number":84,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 761, \"characters\": 3815}","created_at":"2025-11-19 20:08:31.090633+00"},{"id":"007a2c1f-00ab-4794-bd05-c6b5bcb1752c","book_id":"37246b80-7e1c-4367-b638-2a12308a66e0","chunk_index":50,"content":"Every time that you drive it to work the friction sheds into dust a portion of its matter.

Miss Ottley gasped \"Too late!\" and wrung her hands. I handed the medium a glass of water, but he was trembling too violently to take it of himself. He spilt half the contents on his knee. I forced the rest into his mouth. It revived him. A little later he stood up. He was bathed in perspiration, and looked sick. But he rejected all offers of assistance. He seemed to be very angry.

So the other told him, That by that he was gone some distance from the gate, he would come at the house of the Interpreter, at whose door he should knock, and he would show him excellent things. Then Christian took his leave of his friend, and he again bid him God-speed. {70} Then he went on till he came to the house of the Interpreter, where he knocked over and over; at last one came to the door, and asked who was there. {71} CHR. Sir, here is a traveller, who was bid by an acquaintance of the good- man of this house to call here for my profit; I would therefore speak with the master of the house. So he called for the master of the house, who, after a little time, came to Christian, and asked him what he would have. CHR. Sir, said Christian, I am a man that am come from the City of Destruction, and am going to the Mount Zion; and I was told by the man that stands at the gate, at the head of this way, that if I called here, you would show me excellent things, such as would be a help to me in my journey. {72} INTER. Then said the Interpreter, Come in; I will show that which will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his man to light the candle, and bid Christian follow him: so he had him into a private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when he had done, Christian saw the picture of a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it. It had eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back. It stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang over his head. CHR. Then said Christian, What meaneth this? {73} INTER. The man whose picture this is, is one of a thousand; he can beget children [1 Cor. 4:15], travail in birth with children [Gal. 4:19], and nurse them himself when they are born.","page_number":24,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 774, \"characters\": 3885}","created_at":"2025-10-08 04:09:46.459911+00"},{"id":"007e698a-5e52-4edd-9913-7bbd198faf87","book_id":"fedad722-f4d3-40f4-9175-f2f45db78587","chunk_index":118,"content":"Instead of being pulled it is pushed by mules, and merely cuts off the heads, leaving the straw to be trampled down by the animals since it has no value. Swathes as wide as 50 feet are thus treated, the grain being threshed out while the machine moves. One of the most beautiful, and at the same time useful, crops in the world is that of maize, which feeds not only vast numbers of human beings, but also countless flocks and herds, the latter eating the green stalks as well as the ripened grain. The United States alone produced no less than 2,523,648,312 bushels of this cereal in 1902, as against 987,000,000 bushels of wheat, and 670,000,000 bushels of barley. Now, maize has a very tough stalk, often 10 feet high and an inch thick, which cannot be cut with the ease of wheat or barley. So a special machine has been devised to handle it. The row of corn is picked up, if fallen, by chains furnished with projecting spikes working at an angle to the perpendicular, so as to lift and simultaneously pull back the stalks, which pass into a horizontal V -shaped frame. This has a broad opening in front, but narrows towards its rear end, where stationary sickles fixed on either side give the stalk a drawing cut before it reaches the single knife moving to right and left in the angle of the V , which severs the stalk completely. The McCormick machine gathers the corn in vertical bundles, and ties them up ready for the \"shockers.\" THRESHING MACHINES In principle these are simple enough. The straw and grain is fed into a slot and pulled down between a toothed rotating drum and a fixed toothed concave. These tear out the grain from the ear. The former falls into the hopper of a winnowing and riddling machine, which clears it from dust and husks, and allows it to pass to a hopper. An endless chain of buckets carries it to the delivery bins, holding just one sackful each, which when full discharge the grain through spouts into the receptacles waiting below their mouths. An automatic counter records the number of sackfuls of corn that have been discharged, so that dishonesty on the part of employés becomes practically an impossibility. While the grain is thus treated, oscillating rakes have arranged the straw and shaken it out behind in a form convenient for binding, and the chaff has passed to its proper heap, to be used as fuel for the engine or as food for cattle. PETROL-DRIVEN FIELD MACHINERY On water, rail, and road the petrol engine has entered into rivalry with steam—very successfully too. And now it bids fair to challenge both steam- engine and horse as the motive power for agricultural operations. Probably the best-known English petrol-driven farmer's help is that made by Mr. Dan Albone, of Biggleswade, who in past times did much to introduce the safety bicycle to the public. The \"Ivel\" motor is not beautiful to look upon; its sides are slab, its outlines rather suggestive of an inverted punt. But it is a willing and powerful worker; requires no feeding in the early hours of the morning; no careful brush down after the day's work; no halts to ease wearied muscles. In one tank is petrol, in another lubricating oil, in a third water to keep the cylinders cool. A double-cylinder motor of 18 h.p. transmits its energy through a large clutch and train of cogs to the road wheels, made extra wide and well corrugated so that they shall not sink into soft ground or slip on hard. There is a broad pulley-wheel peeping out from one side of the machine, which is ready to drive chaff-cutters or threshers, pump, grind corn, or turn a dynamo at a moment's notice. A MOTOR PLOUGH A MOTOR PLOUGH The \"Ivel\" Agricultural Motor pulling a three-furrow plough. A motor thus harnessed will plough six acres a day at a total cost per acre of five shillings. It is also available for reaping, threshing, chaff-cutting, and other duties on a farm. Hitch the \"Ivel\" on to a couple of reapers or a three-furrow plough, and it soon shows its superiority to \"man's friend.\" Here are some records:— Eleven acres, one rood, thirteen poles of wet loam land ploughed in 17 1 2 hours, at a cost per acre of 5s. Nineteen acres of wheat reaped and bound in 10 hours, at a cost of 1s. 9d. per acre. Fifteen acres, three roods of heavy grass cut in 3 1 2 hours, cost, 1s. per acre. With horses the average cost of ploughing is about 10s. an acre; of reaping 5s. So that the motor does at least twice the work for the same money.","page_number":294,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 800, \"characters\": 4444}","created_at":"2025-10-08 18:14:15.62875+00"},{"id":"007e75b6-3ab1-4a5e-8f35-7c6d4fca80f0","book_id":"4c1613fc-6856-42f4-a5c7-96e7deb67174","chunk_index":103,"content":"No letters had reached him for weeks. Removed from the sphere of the abnormal activity which had been his, and with nothing to do but sit and think, Donald had, for some time, been examining his own heart with an introspective gaze more searching than ever before. He felt that he had been, above the average, blessed with happy relationships, deep friendships and a highly trained ability to serve others—and he knew that he could honestly say that he had turned this to full account. Besides, he was betrothed to a beautiful woman whom many coveted. When his mind reached Marion Treville in its consideration, it stopped to build a dream castle around her, a castle not in Spain, but in America. He had earned the right to rest beside the road awhile, and enjoy the good things of life. Marion was waiting for him at home, and whatever doubts had, at one or another time, entered his mind as to their perfect suitability, one for the other, they had long since been banished. Distance had lent its enchantment, and he had supplied her with the special virtues that he desired. His was a type of mind which held to one thought at a time, and he had always possessed a fixedness of purpose of a kind well calculated to carry through any plan which that mind conceived. Combined, these characteristics made a form of egotism, not one which caused him to overrate himself, but to plough ahead regardless of the strength of the possible opposition. When he returned to America he would marry Marion Treville immediately. No other idea had seriously entered his mind since they had plighted their troth; they had not been quite ready before, that was all, he told himself. It was in such a frame of mind, and with a growing eagerness for the day when he might start for home to claim his reward, that he received her long-delayed letter. What it said does not matter; but one paragraph summed up her whole confession. \"You cannot but agree with me that ours was never the love of a man and woman whose hearts were attuned to one another, and sang in perfect unison. We really drifted into an engagement more because of propinquity than anything else. I am a drone—the product of society at its worst—and you are one of the workers, Donald. I feel quite sure that you will always gain your truest happiness in your work. Although I know how you love children (and I don't), I cannot think of you in the rôle of a married man, so I do not, deep in my heart, believe that this is going to hurt you very much—certainly I hope not. Indeed, I have a somewhat unpleasant suspicion that some day you are going to bless me for having given you back your freedom.\" Donald read the letter through, without allowing his expression to change. Then he started to reread it, stopped, and suddenly crumpled it up in his big fist. A low curse escaped his lips. It was heard by a passing nurse, who hurried to him with the question, \"Did you call, doctor? Are you in pain?\" \"No. Let me alone,\" was his harsh answer, and the patient girl moved away, with a little shake of her head. The great physician had not been his cheerful, kindly self for some time. Perhaps she surmised, too, that the mail which she had laid in his lap had not been all that he had anticipated. With scarcely a move, he sat, staring in front of him, until the evening shadows had turned the landscape to a dull monotone. Then he slowly arose, and, with his mind so completely bent upon one subject that his body was a thing apart and its weakness forgotten, stepped out into the darkening city. Time had ceased to exist for him, as he walked the almost deserted streets of Toul like a flesh-and-blood automaton. But the physical exercise brought a quota of mental relief at last, and the cool night air soothed his first burning pain and anger with its unconscious balm. At length he was able to face the truth frankly, and then he suddenly knew that all the time it was not his heart, so much as his pride, which had been hurt. An hour earlier he would not have admitted a single doubt of his real love for Marion Treville. Now he could not but admit that the initial stab of bitterness was being healed by a real, though inexplicable, sense of relief. He could even say that she had been right. His affection for her had, indeed, been merely the outgrowth of life-long intimacy.","page_number":195,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 789, \"characters\": 4333}","created_at":"2025-07-19 11:22:09.663985+00"},{"id":"007fe3cd-5aaa-4d24-b092-c2039bafcde4","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":781,"content":"DON JOHN.

No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment. BENEDICK. Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her. CLAUDIO. Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her. BENEDICK. Would you buy her, that you enquire after her? CLAUDIO. Can the world buy such a jewel? BENEDICK. Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song? CLAUDIO. In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on. BENEDICK.

Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter. CLAUDIO. If this were so, so were it uttered. BENEDICK. Like the old tale, my lord: ‘it is not so, nor ’twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.’ CLAUDIO. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise. DON PEDRO. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy. CLAUDIO. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord. DON PEDRO. By my troth, I speak my thought. CLAUDIO. And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine. BENEDICK. And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine. CLAUDIO. That I love her, I feel. DON PEDRO. That she is worthy, I know. BENEDICK.

So up they went and up, till they came to a level place whereon was built the chief hall and its chambers: there they stood awhile to breathe them before the door, which was rather low than great; and Ursula clung to Ralph and trembled, but Ralph spake in her ear: “Take heart, my sweet, or these men, and Roger in especial, will think the worse of thee; and thou a Friend of the Well. What! here is naught to hurt thee! this is naught beside the perils of the desert, and the slaves and the evil lord of Utterbol.” “Yea,” she said, “but meseemeth I loved thee not so sore as now I do. O friend, I am become a weak woman and unvaliant, and there is naught in me but love of thee, and love of life because of thee; nor dost thou know altogether what befell me in that hall.” But Ralph turned about and cried out in a loud, cheerful voice: “Let us enter, friends! and lo you, I will show the Champions of the Dry Tree the way into their own hall and high place.” Therewith he thrust the door open, for it was not locked, and strode into the hall, still leading Ursula by the hand, and all the company followed him, the clash of their armour resounding through the huge building. Though it was long, it was not so much that it was long as that it was broad, and exceeding high, so that in the dusk of it the great vault of the roof was dim and misty. There was no man therein, no halling on its walls, no benches nor boards, naught but the great standing table of stone on the dais, and the stone high-seat amidst of it: and the place did verily seem like the house and hall of a people that had died out in one hour because of their evil deeds. They stood still a moment when they were all fairly within doors, and Roger thrust up to Ralph and said, but softly: “The woman is blenching, and all for naught; were it not for the oath, we had best have left her in the thorp: I fear me she will bring evil days on our old home with her shivering fear. How far otherwise came our Lady in hither when first she came amongst us, when the Duke of us found her in the wood after she had been thrust out from Sunway by the Baron whom thou slewest afterward. Our Duke brought her in hither wrapped up in his knight’s scarlet cloak, and went up with her on to the dais; but when she came thither, she turned about and let her cloak fall to earth, and stood there barefoot in her smock, as she had been cast out into the wildwood, and she spread abroad her hands, and cried out in a loud voice as sweet as the May blackbird, ‘May God bless this House and the abode of the valiant, and the shelter of the hapless.’” Said Ursula (and her voice was firm and the colour come back to her cheeks now, while Ralph stood agaze and wondering): “Roger, thou lovest me little, meseemeth, though if I did less than I do, I should do against the will of thy Lady that was Queen in this hall. But tell me, Roger, where is gone that other one, the fearful she-bear of this crag, who sat in yonder stone high-seat, and roared at me and mocked me, and gave me over into the hands of her tormentors, who haled me away to the prison wherefrom thy very Lady delivered me?” “Lady,” said Roger, “the tale of her is short since the day thou sawest her herein. On the day when we first had the evil tidings of the slaying of my Lady we were sad at heart, and called to mind ancient transgressions against us; therefore we fell on the she-bear, as thou callest her, and her company of men and women, and some we slew and some we thrust forth; but as to her, I slew her not three feet from where thou standest now.","page_number":436,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 722, \"characters\": 3681}","created_at":"2025-10-08 17:59:50.664507+00"},{"id":"00878f9b-4185-4d8b-b2a3-f133d01506fa","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":237,"content":"KING.

Ah, I thought so! LORD GORING. I forbid you to enter that room. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Stand back. My life is at stake. And I don’t care who is there. I will know who it is to whom I have told my secret and my shame. [ Enters room .] LORD GORING. Great heavens! his own wife! [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN comes back , with a look of scorn and anger on his face .] SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What explanation have you to give me for the presence of that woman here? LORD GORING. Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. She is a vile, an infamous thing! LORD GORING. Don’t say that, Robert! It was for your sake she came here. It was to try and save you she came here. She loves you and no one else. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You are mad. What have I to do with her intrigues with you? Let her remain your mistress! You are well suited to each other. She, corrupt and shameful—you, false as a friend, treacherous as an enemy even— LORD GORING. It is not true, Robert. Before heaven, it is not true. In her presence and in yours I will explain all. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Let me pass, sir. You have lied enough upon your word of honour. [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN goes out . LORD GORING rushes to the door of the drawing– room , when MRS. CHEVELEY comes out , looking radiant and much amused .] MRS. CHEVELEY. [ With a mock curtsey ] Good evening, Lord Goring! LORD GORING. Mrs. Cheveley! Great heavens! … May I ask what you were doing in my drawing–room? MRS. CHEVELEY. Merely listening. I have a perfect passion for listening through keyholes. One always hears such wonderful things through them. LORD GORING. Doesn’t that sound rather like tempting Providence? MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! surely Providence can resist temptation by this time. [ Makes a sign to him to take her cloak off , which he does .] 47 LORD GORING. I am glad you have called. I am going to give you some good advice. MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! pray don’t. One should never give a woman anything that she can’t wear in the evening. LORD GORING. I see you are quite as wilful as you used to be. MRS. CHEVELEY. Far more! I have greatly improved. I have had more experience. LORD GORING. Too much experience is a dangerous thing. Pray have a cigarette. Half the pretty women in London smoke cigarettes. Personally I prefer the other half. MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. I never smoke. My dressmaker wouldn’t like it, and a woman’s first duty in life is to her dressmaker, isn’t it? What the second duty is, no one has as yet discovered. LORD GORING. You have come here to sell me Robert Chiltern’s letter, haven’t you? MRS. CHEVELEY. To offer it to you on conditions. How did you guess that? LORD GORING. Because you haven’t mentioned the subject. Have you got it with you? MRS. CHEVELEY. [ Sitting down .] Oh, no! A well–made dress has no pockets. LORD GORING. What is your price for it? MRS. CHEVELEY. How absurdly English you are! The English think that a cheque–book can solve every problem in life. Why, my dear Arthur, I have very much more money than you have, and quite as much as Robert Chiltern has got hold of. Money is not what I want. LORD GORING. What do you want then, Mrs. Cheveley? MRS. CHEVELEY. Why don’t you call me Laura? LORD GORING. I don’t like the name. MRS. CHEVELEY. You used to adore it.","page_number":51,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 800, \"characters\": 4241}","created_at":"2025-07-19 17:34:55.870053+00"},{"id":"0089627a-064d-461c-947d-33a0119002cd","book_id":"885857a9-3c23-42aa-8e41-fd9e2cc9fa05","chunk_index":83,"content":"Next to the virtue, the fun in this world is what we can least spare. —A GNES S TRICKLAND .

Joy moves the dazzling wheels that roll In the great timepiece of Creation. —S CHILLER . \"He is as stiff as a poker,\" said a friend of a man who could never be coaxed or tempted to smile. \"Stiff as a poker,\" exclaimed another, \"why he would set an example to a poker.\" Even Christians are not celebrated for entering into the joy of their Lord. We are told that \"Pascal would not permit himself to be conscious of the relish of his food; he prohibited all seasonings and spices, however much he might wish for and need them; and he actually died because he forced his diseased stomach to receive at each meal a certain amount of aliment, neither more nor less, whatever might be his appetite at the time, or his utter want of appetite. He wore a girdle armed with iron spikes, which he was accustomed to drive in upon his body (his fleshless ribs) as often as he thought himself in need of such admonition. He was annoyed and offended if any in his hearing might chance to say that they had just seen a beautiful woman. He rebuked a mother who permitted her own children to give her their kisses. Toward a loving sister, who devoted herself to his comfort, he assumed an artificial harshness of manner for the express purpose , as he acknowledged, of revolting her sisterly affection.\" And all this sprung from the simple principle that earthly enjoyment was inconsistent with religion. We should fight against every influence which tends to depress the mind, as we would against a temptation to crime. A depressed mind prevents the free action of the diaphragm and the expansion of the chest. It stops the secretions of the body, interferes with the circulation of the blood in the brain, and deranges the entire functions of the body. Scrofula and consumption often follow protracted depressions of mind. That \"fatal murmur\" which is heard in the upper lobes of the lungs in the first stages of consumption, often follows depressed spirits after some great misfortune or sorrow. Victims of suicide are almost always in a depressed state from exhausted vitality, loss of nervous energy, dyspepsia, worry, anxiety, trouble, or grief. \"Mirth is God's medicine,\" says a wise writer; \"everybody ought to bathe in it. Grim care, moroseness, anxiety—all the rust of life, ought to be scoured off by the oil of mirth.\" It is better than emery. Every man ought to rub himself with it. A man without mirth is like a wagon without springs, in which one is caused disagreeably to jolt by every pebble over which it runs. A man with mirth is like a chariot with springs, in which one can ride over the roughest roads and scarcely feel anything but a pleasant rocking motion. \"I have told you,\" said Southey, \"of the Spaniard who always put on spectacles when about to eat cherries, in order that the fruit might look larger and more tempting. In like manner I make the most of my enjoyments; and though I do not cast my eyes away from my troubles, I pack them in as small a compass as I can for myself, and never let them annoy others.\" We all know the power of good cheer to magnify everything. Travelers are told by the Icelanders, who live amid the cold and desolation of almost perpetual winter, that \"Iceland is the best land the sun shines upon.\" \"You are on the shady side of seventy, I expect?\" was asked of an old man. \"No,\" was the reply, \"I am on the sunny side; for I am on the side nearest to glory.\" A cheerful man is pre-eminently a useful man. He does not cramp his mind, nor take half-views of men and things. He knows that there is much misery, but that misery need not be the rule of life. He sees that in every state people may be cheerful; the lambs skip, birds sing and fly joyously, puppies play, kittens are full of joyance, the whole air full of careering and rejoicing insects; that everywhere the good outbalances the bad, and that every evil has its compensating balm. \"Bishop Fénelon is a delicious man,\" said Lord Peterborough; \"I had to run away from him to prevent his making me a Christian.\" Hume, the historian, never said anything truer than—\"To be happy, the person must be cheerful and gay, not gloomy and melancholy.","page_number":156,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 790, \"characters\": 4368}","created_at":"2025-10-17 17:57:18.532498+00"},{"id":"008a8eac-122f-4c4b-a4d5-3e9ed846dc55","book_id":"cf302acf-5864-4a44-8cfd-9d3f425a4305","chunk_index":15,"content":"When the cart-road was being built every one said it would be spoilt. And now, when the construction of a railway is in contemplation, exactly the same remark is made. The impression conveyed is that the pleasures of travel in Kashmir are surely and steadily deteriorating. And this, no doubt, is true in certain aspects. Supplies are dearer. Coolies demand higher wages. The visitor disposed to solitude more frequently encounters his fellow Britisher. These are decided drawbacks, and the visitor who telegraphs to Danjhibhoy for a tonga, to Nedou's for a room in the hotel, and to Cockburn's for a house-boat, and has simply to pay his fare and his hotel bill, no doubt pines for the virgin time of Kashmir travel before the rattle of the tongas or the tooting of the motor car was heard in the valley. Yet I doubt if all was bliss in those \"good old days.\" Certainly Moorcroft, the first Englishman to visit Kashmir, had no very comfortable time, and must often in his turn have pined for a good hotel, a clean room, and a decent dinner—and, who knows, for a game of golf? Moorcroft visited Kashmir in 1823, and first had enormous difficulty in obtaining from Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, to whom Kashmir was then subject, leave to come to Kashmir at all. He arrived there from the north in the autumn, and had fresh difficulty in obtaining permission to remain there for the winter. At the quarters he occupied he was \"beset by crowds of people who not only filled the garden, but also came in boats.\" He was pursued wherever he went by inquisitive crowds, by importunate beggars, and by suspicious officials. When he wished to make short excursions from Srinagar objections were at once raised. When he was at length allowed to leave for the Lolab, officials were appointed to accompany him \"to watch his proceedings and check inquisitiveness.\" And when he finally left Kashmir for the Punjab by the Jhelum valley he was stopped by a small semi-independent chief near Uri, who demanded Rs. 15,000 as customs duty on his caravan, and as Moorcroft refused to pay more than Rs. 500 he was compelled to return to Srinagar and reach the Punjab by another route. These certainly were not the halcyon days of Kashmir travel. But I suppose there must have been an intermediate time between then and now when travelling in Kashmir was perfection to those who had time enough at their disposal to \"march\" in. In those delightful times the traveller pitched his little camp wherever he wished. Grain was ridiculously cheap. Fowls were considered dear at twopence each. Coolies were thankful enough to get any payment at all. There were no game laws or game licences, so that the sportsman could shoot to his heart's content. The number of visitors for the year was restricted to 100, so that each had 700 or 800 square miles to himself, and there was no need of dress clothes, white shirts, or Ascot dresses. When I first visited Kashmir in the autumn of 1887 its glory had already begun to depart, though as regards simplicity of travelling my methods were of the simplest. I had no other clothes but what I stood in, and only the under portion of these were of European origin. All my outer clothes, including my boots, were worn out long before I reached Kashmir, and I was accordingly clothed in a long Central Asian robe and high native boots, for I was at the end of a journey of nearly four thousand miles from Peking. I had crossed—and was the first European to accomplish the feat—the Mustagh Pass, 19,000 feet high, into Baltistan; and the \"Pass\" being nothing else than a hard ice slope and a rocky\n\nprecipice, down which I and my five servants and coolies had to let ourselves by means of turbans and waist-clothes tied together, I had been able to carry with me little even of the scanty baggage I had brought up to the other side of the Pass. I had indeed only a roll of bedding, which was thrown down the precipice, and a big kettle. I had no tent and no money! I had slept in the open from one side of the Himalayas to the other, and my funds were entirely exhausted, so that when I landed in Kashmir territory I had to borrow money from the Governor of Baltistan, Pandit Rada Kishen Kol, a very popular and respected official who is still in the Maharaja's service, and is now Chief Judge.","page_number":36,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 770, \"characters\": 4311}","created_at":"2025-07-08 05:20:33.180095+00"},{"id":"008e5b1e-4038-48e2-adb6-f19cd6ea9d06","book_id":"5894b6e6-6c1e-444b-80b4-b566fb844706","chunk_index":9,"content":"XV . \"Happy the age, to which we moderns give The name of 'golden,' when men chose to live On woodland fruits; and for their medicines took Herbs from the field, and simples from the brook.\" or, as epitomised in the time-worn Latin adage:— \"Qui potest mederi simplicibus frustra quaerit composita.\" \"If simple herbs suffice to cure, 'Tis vain to compound drugs endure.\" In the following pages our leading Herbal Simples [12] are reviewed alphabetically; whilst, to ensure accuracy, the genus and species of each plant are particularised. Most of these herbs may be gathered fresh in their proper season by persons who have acquired a knowledge of their parts, and who live in districts where such plants are to be found growing; and to other persons who inhabit towns, or who have no practical acquaintance with Botany, great facilities are now given by our principal druggists for obtaining from their stores concentrated fresh juices of the chief herbal simples. Again, certain preparations of plants used only for their specific curative methods are to be got exclusively from the Homoeopathic chemist, unless gathered at first hand. These, not being officinal, fail to find a place on the shelves of the ordinary Pharmaceutical druggist. Nevertheless, when suitably employed, they are of singular efficacy in curing the maladies to which they stand akin by the law of similars. For convenience of distinction here, the symbol H. will follow such particular preparations, which number in all some seventy-five of the simples described. At the same time any of the more common extracts, juices, and tinctures (or the proper parts of the plants for making these several medicaments), may be readily purchased at the shop of every leading druggist. It has not been thought expedient to include among the Simples for homely uses of cure such powerfully poisonous plants as Monkshood ( Aconite ), Deadly Nightshade ( Belladonna ), Foxglove ( Digitalis ), Hemlock or Henbane (except for some outward uses), and the like dangerous herbs, these being beyond the province of domestic medicine, whilst only to be administered under the advice and guidance of a qualified prescriber. [13] The chief purpose held in view has been to reconsider those safe and sound herbal curative remedies and medicines which were formerly most in vogue as homely simples, whether to be taken or to be outwardly applied. And the main object has been to show with what confidence their uses may be now resumed, or retained under the guidance of modern chemical teachings, and of precise scientific provings. This question equally applies, whether the Simples be employed as auxiliaries by the physician in attendance, or are welcomed for prompt service in a household emergency as ready at hand when the doctor cannot be immediately had. Moreover, such a Manual as the present of approved Herbal Remedies need not by any means be disparaged by the busy practitioner, when his customary medicines seem to be out of place, or are beyond speedy reach; it being well known that a sick person is always ready to accept with eagerness plain assistant remedies sensibly advised from the garden, the store-closet, the spice-box, or the field. \"Of simple medicines, and their powers to cure, A wise physician makes his knowledge sure; Else I or the household in his healing art He stands ill-fitted to take useful part.\" So said Oribasus (freely translated) as long ago as the fourth century, in classic terms prophetic of later times, Simplicium medicamentorum et facultatum quoe in eis insunt cognitio ita necessaria est ut sine eâ nemo rite medicari queat . But after all has been said and done, none the less must it be finally acknowledged in the pathetic utterance of King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon proverb, Nis [14] no wurt woxen on woode ne on felde, per enure mage be lif uphelden . \"No wort is waxen in wood or wold, Which may for ever man's life uphold.\" Neither to be discovered in the quaint Herbals of primitive times, nor to be learnt by the advanced chemical knowledge of modern plant lore, is there any panacea for all the ills to which our flesh is heir, or an elixir of life, which can secure for us a perpetual immunity from sickness. Contra vim mortis nullum medicamentum in hortis , says the rueful Latin distich:— \"No healing herb can conquer death, And so for always give us breath.\" To sum up which humiliating conclusion good George Herbert has put the matter thus with epigrammatic conciseness:— \"St.","page_number":27,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 751, \"characters\": 4488}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:07:37.921327+00"},{"id":"008f7c72-33d4-466c-860b-3b4e1de10352","book_id":"f032b518-ffa8-4d3a-af26-4b8a28dc4472","chunk_index":617,"content":"Psalms Chapter 79 79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. 79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. 79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. 79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. 79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; 79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

He at length proposed to me traveling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business. I was once inclined to it; but, mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an hour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think only of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do. I must record one trait of this good man’s character. He had formerly been in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people, compounded and went to America. There, by a close application to business as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few years. Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditors to an entertainment, at which he thanked them for the easy composition they had favoured him with, and, when they expected nothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest. He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should carry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there. He proposed to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which he would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. He added, that, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile business, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread, etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions from others which would be profitable; and, if I managed well, would establish me handsomely. The thing pleased me; for I was grown tired of London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wished again to see it; therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year, 49 Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording a better prospect. I now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was daily employed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them packed up, doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all was on board, I had a few days’ leisure. On one of these days, I was, to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir William Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars, and of my teaching Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wished to have them first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them. They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that, if I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get a good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.","page_number":42,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 777, \"characters\": 4262}","created_at":"2025-07-19 15:27:30.935134+00"},{"id":"0093ac10-c9cb-4250-a3d6-9007f1cd25a7","book_id":"c880c2c2-46cd-403d-bf88-fff8af688714","chunk_index":61,"content":"A small Arithmetical Machine, by Viscount Mahon, afterwards Earl Stanhope.

The Mechanical Notations of the Difference Engine No. 1. {156} These had been made at my own expense, and were finished by myself and my eldest son, Mr. B.

These drawings and notations would have required for their exhibition about seven or eight hundred square feet of wall. My letter to Mr. Gravatt was forwarded to the Com mis sion ers with his own application for space to exhibit them. The Com mis sion ers declined this offer; yet during the first six weeks of the Exhibition there was at a short distance from the Difference Engine an empty space of wall large enough for the greater part of these instructive diagrams. This portion of wall was afterwards filled up by a vast oil-cloth. Other large portions of wall, to the amount of thousands of square feet, were given up to other oil-cloths, and to numberless carpets. It is evident the Royal Com mis sion ers were much better qualified to judge of furniture for the feet than of furniture for the head. I was myself frequently asked why I did not employ a person to explain the Difference Engine. In reply to some of my friends, I inquired whether, when they purchased a carriage, they expected the builder to pay the wages of their coachman. 〈 FOREIGN VISITORS PUZZLED. 〉 But my greatest difficulty was with foreigners; no explanation I could devise, and I tried many, appeared at all {157} to satisfy their minds. The thing seemed to them entirely in com pre hen sible. That the nation possessing the greatest military and commercial marine in the world—the nation which had spent so much in endeavouring to render perfect the means of finding the longitude—which had recently caused to be computed and published at considerable expense an entirely new set of lunar Tables should not have availed itself at any cost of mechanical means of computing and stereotyping such Tables, seemed entirely beyond their comprehension. At last they asked me whether the Com mis sion ers were bêtes . I assured them that the only one with whom I was personally acquainted certainly was not. When hard pressed by difficult questions, I thought it my duty as an Englishman to save my country’s character, even at the expense of my own. So on one occasion I suggested to my unsatisfied friends that Com mis sion - ers were usually selected from the highest class of society, and that possibly four out of five had never heard of my name. But here again my generous efforts to save the character of my country and its Com mis sion ers entirely failed. Several of my foreign friends had known me in their own homes, and had seen the estimation in which I was held by their own countrymen and by their own sovereign.

It may, perhaps, amuse the reader. A short time after the arrival of Count Strzelecki in England, I had the pleasure of meeting him at the table of a common friend.

Of the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more curable than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their deliberations, and those who are incontinent through habituation are more curable than those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change a habit than to change one’s nature; even habit is hard to change just because it is like nature, as Evenus says: I say that habit’s but long practice, friend, And this becomes men’s nature in the end. * We have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and softness are, and how these states are related to each other. pleasure Three views hostile to pleasure and the arguments for them 11. The study of pleasure and pain belongs to the province of the political philosopher; for he is the architect of the end, with a view to which we call one thing bad and another good without quali fi ca- tion. * Further, it is one of our necessary tasks to consider them; for not only did we lay it down that moral virtue and vice are con- cerned with pains and pleasures, 1 but most people say that happi- ness involves pleasure; this is why the blessed man is called by a name derived from a word meaning enjoyment. * Now ( 1 ) some people think that no pleasure is a good, either in itself or incidentally, since the good and pleasure are not the same; ( 2 ) others think that some pleasures are good but that most are bad. ( 3 ) Again there is a third view, that even if all pleasures are goods, yet the best thing in the world cannot be pleasure. ( 1 ) The reasons given for the view that pleasure is not a good at all are ( a ) that every pleasure is a perceptible process to a natural state, and that no pro- cess is of the same kind as its end, * e.g. no process of building of the same kind as a house. ( b ) A temperate man avoids pleasures. ( c ) A man of practical wisdom pursues what is free from pain, not what is pleasant. ( d ) The pleasures are a hindrance to thought, and the 1 1104 b 8 – 1105 a 13 . 25 30 35 1152 b 5 10 15 the nicomachean ethics vii.11 136 more so the more one delights in them, e.g. in sexual pleasure; for no one could think of anything while absorbed in this. ( e ) There is no art of pleasure; but every good is the product of some art. ( f ) Children and the brutes pursue pleasures. ( 2 ) The reasons for the view that not all pleasures are good are that ( a ) there are pleas- ures that are actually base and objects of reproach, and ( b ) there are harmful pleasures; for some pleasant things are unhealthy. ( 3 ) The reason for the view that the best thing in the world is not pleasure is that pleasure is not an end but a process. Discussion of the view that pleasure is not a good 12. These are pretty much the things that are said. That it does not follow from these grounds that pleasure is not a good, or even the chief good, is plain from the following considerations. (A) ( a ) First, since that which is good may be so in either of two senses (one thing good simply and another good for a particular person), natural constitutions and states of being, and therefore also the corresponding movements and processes, will be correspondingly divisible.","page_number":156,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 782, \"characters\": 4012}","created_at":"2025-11-19 20:08:31.090633+00"},{"id":"0094bf91-910b-44f4-9e1d-fe8727fa889b","book_id":"5f3d597b-09e8-486d-84f5-58f72a604925","chunk_index":73,"content":"I have been watching by you!” He looked surprised for an instant, and then I could see that his habit of judging for himself came into play. “Watching by me! How do you mean? Why watching by me?” His eye had now lit on his heavily bandaged wrist. He went on in a different tone; less aggressive, more genial, as of one accepting facts: “Are you a doctor?” I felt myself almost smiling as I answered; the relief from the long pressure of anxiety regarding his life was beginning to tell: “No, sir!” “Then why are you here? If you are not a doctor, what are you?” His tone was again more dictatorial. Thought is quick; the whole train of reasoning on which my answer must be based flooded through my brain before the words could leave my lips. Margaret! I must think of Margaret! This was her father, who as yet knew nothing of me; even of my very existence. He would be naturally curious, if not anxious, to know why I amongst men had been chosen as his daughter’s friend on the occasion of his illness. Fathers are naturally a little jealous in such matters as a daughter’s choice, and in the undeclared state of my love for Margaret I must do nothing which could ultimately embarrass her. “I am a Barrister. It is not, however, in that capacity I am here; but simply as a friend of your daughter. It was probably her knowledge of my being a lawyer which first determined her to ask me to come when she thought you had been murdered. Afterwards she was good enough to consider me to be a friend, and to allow me to remain in accordance with your expressed wish that someone should remain to watch.” Mr. Trelawny was manifestly a man of quick thought, and of few words. He gazed at me keenly as I spoke, and his piercing eyes seemed to read my thought. To my relief he said no more on the subject just then, seeming to accept my words in simple faith. There was evidently in his own mind some cause for the acceptance deeper than my own knowledge. His eyes flashed, and there was an unconscious movement of the mouth—it could hardly be called a twitch—which betokened satisfaction. He was following out some train of reasoning in his own mind. Suddenly he said: “She thought I had been murdered! Was that last night?” “No! four days ago.” He seemed surprised. Whilst he had been speaking the first time he had sat up in bed; now he made a movement as though he would jump out. With an effort, however, he restrained himself; leaning back on his pillows he said quietly: “Tell me all about it! All you know! Every detail! Omit nothing! But stay; first lock the door! I want to know, before I see anyone, exactly how things stand.” Somehow his last words made my heart leap. “Anyone!” He evidently accepted me, then, as an exception. In my present state of feeling for his daughter, this was a comforting thought. I felt exultant as I went over to the door and softly turned the key. When I came back I found him sitting up again. He said: “Go on!” Accordingly, I told him every detail, even of the slightest which I could remember, of what had happened from the moment of my arrival at the house. Of course I said nothing of my feeling towards Margaret, and spoke only concerning those things already within his own knowledge. With regard to Corbeck, I simply said that he had brought back some lamps of which he had been in quest. Then I proceeded to tell him fully of their loss, and of their re-discovery in the house. He listened with a self-control which, under the circumstances, was to me little less than marvellous. It was impassiveness, for at times his eyes would flash or blaze, and the strong fingers of his uninjured hand would grip the sheet, pulling it into far-extending wrinkles. This was most noticeable when I told him of the return of Corbeck, and the finding of the lamps in the boudoir. At times he spoke, but only a few words, and as if unconsciously in emotional comment. The mysterious parts, those which had most puzzled us, seemed to have no special interest for him; he seemed to know them already. The utmost concern he showed was when I told him of Daw’s shooting. His muttered comment: “stupid ass!” together with a quick glance across the room at the injured cabinet, marked the measure of his disgust.","page_number":144,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 775, \"characters\": 4235}","created_at":"2025-10-28 04:14:17.396225+00"},{"id":"00950859-8046-4abf-99c7-4f2908b5bade","book_id":"d60016b8-3356-442f-a7a1-0bcd6bf770c3","chunk_index":33,"content":"At any rate, it was adequate. When I came down to breakfast a few days later, Aunt Emmy held a letter towards me with a shaking hand. Her lips trembled. She could not articulate. \"Am I really to read it?\" She nodded. It was a charming letter, written in a delicate, refined hand. Mr. Kingston had not heard of her father's death till the day before he wrote. He had been away up- country for a year, broken shoulder, etc. He was starting for England at once. He should travel almost as quickly as his letter. He should present himself at Pembridge Square and learn her address directly he landed. His ship was the Sultana . I took up the morning paper. \"The Sultana arrived yesterday,\" I said. I looked at the envelope. It was directed on from Pembridge Square. \"Tom will give him my address,\" said Aunt Emmy faintly. \"I wonder how he knows I am not living there now. He will—arrive here—to-day. \" She looked straight in front of her through the open windows to the hollyhocks basking in the still September sunshine. A radiance lit up her face, like that which perhaps shone on Christian's when at last across the river he saw the pearl gates of the New Jerusalem. \"At last!\" she said. \"After all these years! After all these dreadful, dreadful years!\" An unbearable pain went through me. It was not new to me. I had known it once before, when I had seen my child sicken. Why did it return now? The radiance passed. A pitiful trembling shook her like a leaf. Her eyes turned helplessly to mine, frightened and dimmed. \"I forgot I am an old woman,\" she said. I kissed her hand. I told her that she was handsomer than any one. She was very dignified and gentle. \"You are very kind to me, my dear, and it is sweet of you to feel as you do. I believe, as you say, that I am still nice-looking. But the fact remains that it is nearly twenty-five years since we have seen each other. I was nineteen then. And oh! I suppose I ought not to say it, but I was pretty. People turned to look at me in the street. And now I am forty-four.\" \"But he is older than you, isn't he?\" \"Two years. What is two years! We were the same age when we were young. But a man of forty-six is younger than a woman of forty-four.\" I was silent. There was no contradicting that obvious fact. \"He will probably come by the 4.12 train,\" said Aunt Emmy, rising. \"If you don't mind, as there are so many preparations to make, I will leave you to finish your breakfast. I have had mine.\" She left the room, and I stared at her empty plate. I was not hungry either. I was frightened for my dear Aunt Emmy. And yet, she was so yielding, so selfless, so absolutely uncritical, that if any woman could marry late she was the woman. She could have lived with a monster of egotism without finding it out. Had she not devoted herself to two such monsters most of her life? And perhaps Mr. Kingston was not a monster. Aunt Emmy arranged the flowers early as she only could arrange them. I was only allowed to fetch the water and clean the glasses. A certain pony-cart was sent to Muddington with the cook in it to buy a tongue, and a Stilton cheese, and a little barrel of anchovies, and various other condiments which Uncle Tom approved. Uncle Tom's tastes represented those of his whole sex for Aunt Emmy. I insisted on her eating some luncheon, but this was barely possible, as in the midst of it a telegram was brought in from Mr. Kingston to say he should arrive by the 4.12 train. After luncheon Aunt Emmy went to her room.","page_number":68,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 657, \"characters\": 3486}","created_at":"2025-10-17 18:25:52.917405+00"},{"id":"00967e39-e066-42ab-b292-4b96c9df9564","book_id":"7bc76a22-d3c3-4c6d-b485-94a4cfa0e0c5","chunk_index":1,"content":"Better to advise the young man of the dangers, suggest a daytime crossing. Perhaps even try a little reverse psychology. The boy, if he could be called that, was growing impatient. \"I'll be all right with a life-jacket. The boat won't be overloaded. Just the three of us. My cousin and her kid are going with me.\" The old man's eyes stirred from the damp reverie of the previous moment. \"I can't let you take a child out into that. The water's choppy at best. You know next to nothing about handling a craft if she takes on water or if it becomes turbulent. Why are you in such an all-fired hurry to get across anyhow?\" \"Let's just say it's my business. My uncle supplies you with business during the summer months. He has a boat in tow here now. I'm responsible. It's still normal weather for this time of year.

I can only suggest, well that you await next morning and only take two across at one time. Many a person has received a cruel surprise out there. Why this area's full of tales dating back to the earliest times concerning drownings. Why from the time of the Loyalists up through my earliest childhood--all the time in between that--my family has run the marina and it seems someone is claimed yearly by this lake. The French didn't call it an inland ocean for nothing. Some even claim there's tides--real swells that will take a boat and . . .\" \"The French, the Loyalists. I'm not here to listen to a travelog. What do I care if a long list of idiots blundered to their doom. I'm now and intend to keep on living. What should I care about the past!\" \"That may very well be, son, but nobody sets out to drown. Even on the calmest days a sudden storm whips up and . . . I remember my daddy telling of a group of early settlers up from the Bay of Quinte area crossing to attend a church service--full seven of them drowned after a heavy wind whipped . . . .\" \"Church,\" snorted the other. \"Well, I'm not going to any church that's for sure.\" He broke into a snicker, his dark eyes flashing above a set of stained teeth. \"Yes, I guess you're not. Your type will . . . .\" \"My type, is it? My type is not so gutless as you, that's a fact. A little natural obstacle doesn't send me shivering to the nearest root cellar. This is near winter. You have to bloody well expect a little discomfort at this time.\" He had unnotched the first of several ropes securing the craft. The boat, a little three seater, sturdy, but otherwise quite frail was bobbing up then down as each successive dark wave hobnolled it against the current. It looked for all the world like a large, red currant fleshy against the wind. The young man checked the fuel, began to rev the motor before glancing toward the distant shore. A package of cigarettes emerged from his coat pocket. Blue gray puffs, sentinel like, climbed the air about his person. He spat into the water and proceeded to throw the match after it. Both whirled in the spray, then disappeared from sight. The old man sensed his growing uneasiness but that resilient pride checked any apparition of modesty. \"Put the fare on my uncle's account. I'll return the boat tomorrow morning.\" Little lights some ten miles distant were fingering the early darkness. Something near the water's edge bobbed cork-like in the growing dusk. Always the worst time of day, the old man pondered, a process of diminishing returns. Not quite dark, sure as hell not light--an in between shudder world, a limbo of gray. \"When will the girl and her baby be along?\", the old man queried. \"I'll see to that. You never mind. Go back inside, pop, where it's warm. You'll feel better. Entering the number and registration just about does it. I'll keep you posted,\" he laughed a growing laugh that tore soft wind from his mouth. He spat again, returned to his car and was soon out of sight. The old man looked wearily at the ground. He was recalling more and more of that early story his dad passed down from his dad concerning the overcrowded boat up Adolphustown way so many years ago. If God allowed decent churchgoers to be snuffed from sight in the act of attending His worship, think of what must await young fools who defy His natural laws. To be drowned outright was bad enough.","page_number":7,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 795, \"characters\": 4323}","created_at":"2025-10-17 18:25:50.45701+00"},{"id":"00968cf8-6595-4838-b52f-c7650b5cfe12","book_id":"34f48940-2d21-4ebe-b2dd-0ffe2acc2961","chunk_index":79,"content":"Now all these things were indeed discovered by the exer cise of reason, but not by reason in its perfect form. They were invented by ordinary men, not by philosophers - just as, let me add, were the vessels we cross rivers and seas in, with sails designed to catch the drive of the winds and rud ders at the stem to alter the vessel's course in this or that direction {the idea being taken from the fish, who steers with his tail, one slight movement of it to either side being enough to alter the direction of his darting course). ' All these things,' says Posidonius, 'were invented by our philosopher. They were, however, rather too unimportant for him to handle personally, and so he passed them over to the minions among his assistants.' No, the fact is that this sort of thing was not thought up by anyone other than the people who make them their concern today. We know very well that some have only appeared within living memory, the use, for example, of windows letting in the full daylight through transparent panes, or bathrooms heated from beneath with pipes set in the walls in order to diffuse the heat and thus maintain an even temperature at the highest as well as the lowest room levels. Need I mention the marble with which our temples and even houses are resplendent? Or the rounded and polished blocks on which we rest whole colonnades and buildings capable of holding large crowds of people? Or the shorthand symbols by means of which even a rapidly delivered speech is 170 XC, 31 LETTER X C taken down and the hand is able to keep up with the quickness of the tongue? These are inventions of the lowest slaves. Philosophy is far above all this ; she does not train men's hands : she is the instructress of men's minds. You want to know, do you, what philosophy has unearthed, what philosophy has achieved? It is not the gracefulness of dance movements, nor the variety of sounds produced by hom or flute as they take in breath and transform it, in its passage through or out of the instrument, into notes. She does not set about constructing arms or walls or anything of use in war. On the contrary, her voice is for peace, calling all mankind to live in harmony. And she is not, I insist, the manufacturer of equipment for everyday essential purposes. Why must you make her responsible for such insignificant things? In her you see the mistress of the art of life itsel£ She has, indeed, authority over other arts, inasmuch as all activities that provide life with its apparatus must also be the servants of that of which life itself is the servant. Philosophy, however, takes as her aim the state of happiness. That is the direction in which she opens routes and guides us. She shows us what are real and what are only apparent evils. She strips men's minds of empty thinking, bestows a greatness that is solid and administers a check to greatness where it is puff ed up and all an empty show ; she sees that we are left in no doubt about the difference between what is great and what is bloated. And she imparts a knowledge of the whole of nature, as well as of herself. She explains what the gods are, and what they are like. . . . * ' Anacharsis,' says Posidonius, ' discovered the potter's wheel, the rotary motion of which shapes earthenware.' Then, mention of the potter's wheel being found in Homer, * About 17 lines (§§28 to 30, in which Seneca appears to claim for philosophy complete and certain knowledge of the . truth in religious or cosmological matteiS) have been omitted. 171 LETTER S FROM A STOIC xc, 3 1 he would have us think that it is the passage in Homer, rather than his story, that is spurious. I maintain that Anachar sis was not responsible for this invention, and that even if he was, he discovered it as a philosopher, yes, but not in his capacity as a philosopher, in the same way as philosophers do plenty of things as men without doing them in their capacity as philosophers. Suppose, for example, a philosopher happens to be a very fast runner ; in a race he will come first by virtue of his ability as a runner, not by virtue of his being a phil sopher.","page_number":158,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 755, \"characters\": 4112}","created_at":"2025-08-27 13:32:23.147613+00"},{"id":"0096be98-23ff-412b-8058-4740508a8f79","book_id":"ecfe9883-0715-44e4-a292-9e6470b1a262","chunk_index":13,"content":"A los tebanos y a los fliasios pidieron dineros, y a lo eleos solamente los cascos de las naves y dinero. Y de los mismos corintio fueron dispuestas treinta naves y tres mil hombres. Cuando los corcirenses supieron estos aprestos de guerra, vinieron a Corinto con los embajadores de Lacedemonia y de Sición que tomaron consigo, y demandaron a los corintios que sacasen la guarnición y lo moradores que habían metido en Epidamno, pues ellos nada tenían que ve con los epidamnios; y si no lo querían hacer, que nombrasen jueces en e Peloponeso, en aquellas ciudades que ambas partes eligiesen, y que la población fuese de aquellos que los jueces determinasen por sentencia, o que lo remitiesen al oráculo de Apolo, que estaba en Delfos, y no se permitiese guerrear unos contra otros. De lo contrario serían forzados a hacerse amigo de aquella parcialidad que más poderosa fuese, para su bien y provecho. Lo corintios les respondieron que sacasen sus naves y los bárbaros de Epidamno y que después consultarían sobre ello, porque no era razón que estando lo unos cercados, los otros quisiesen llevar la cosa por tela de juicio. Lo corcirenses replicaron que si los corintios sacaban primero a los que habían metido en la ciudad de Epidamno, ellos también lo harían así y que estaban dispuestos a que se apartaran unos y otros de la tierra, y ajustar treguas hasta tanto que la cuestión se resolviera en justicia. Los corintios, no accediendo porque tenían sus naves a punto y lo compañeros de guerra aparejados, enviaron un trompeta a los corcirenses que les denunciase la guerra: alzaron velas del puerto con setenta y cinco naves y dos mil hombres de pelea, y navegaron derechos a Epidamno. Eran capitane de la armada de mar Aristeo, hijo de Pélico, Calícrates, hijo de Calias, y Timánor, hijo de Timantes. Y por tierra, de la gente de infantería, Arquetimo, hijo de Euritimo, e Isárquidas, hijo de Isarco. Llegados que fueron al cabo de Accio, tierra de Anactorio, donde está el templo de Apolo, en la boca del seno de Ambracia los corcirenses les enviaron un mensaje con un barco mercante prohibiéndoles el paso, y entretanto completaron el número de sus naves y aprestaron jarcias y aparejos para las viejas, de suerte que pudieran navegar, y poniéndolas todas a punto, esperaban la respuesta de su mensaje. Mas despué que volvió el mensajero y dijo que no había esperanza de paz, como ya lo corcirenses tenían sus naves aparejadas, que serían en número de ochenta porque cuarenta de ellas estaban en el cerco de Epidamno, salieron a encuentro de los corintios, y poniendo sus naves en orden de batalla embistieron contra la armada de los corintios, los desbarataron y vencieron, y destrozaron quince naves de ella. Acaeció el mismo día que los que estaban cercados en Epidamno concertaron que los extranjeros y advenedizos fuesen vendidos por cautivos, y los corintios guardados en prisión hasta saber la voluntad de los vencedores. Después de esta victoria naval, los corcirenses pusieron trofeo en señal de triunfo en el campo de Leucimna, que está en el cabo de Corcira, y mandando matar a todos los cautivos que prendieron, solamente guardaron en prisión a los corintios. Acabado esto, los corintios y sus compañeros de guerra vencidos en la mar, volvieron a sus casas; los corcirenses se hicieron dueño de la mar en todas aquellas comarcas, y navegando para Léucade, colonia de los corintios, la robaron y destruyeron; y quemaron a Cilene, donde los eleo tenían sus atarazanas, porque habían socorrido a los corintios con naves y con dinero. Mucho tiempo después de esta batalla, dominaron los corcirenses la mar, y navegando hacían todo el mal y daño que podían a los amigos y aliado de los corintios, hasta que estos, pasado el verano, les enviaron naves y ejército, de que tenían gran falta, y asentaron su campo en el cabo de Accio y cerca de Quimerio, en Tesprótide, para poder mejor guardar a Léucade y a la otras ciudades de los amigos y compañeros que estaban de su parte. Lo corcirenses pusieron su campamento en Leucimna por mar y por tierra frente del campo de los enemigos, y así estuvieron quedos, sin hacerse mal los uno a los otros, todo aquel verano, hasta que, llegado el invierno, volvieron a su casas. Todo aquel año, después de la batalla naval, y el siguiente, los corintios por la ira y saña que tenían contra los corcirenses, determinaron renovar la guerra, y mandando rehacer sus naves, aparejaron una nueva armada cogiendo hombres de guerra y marineros a sueldo del Peloponeso, y de otras tierras de Grecia.","page_number":32,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 775, \"characters\": 4542}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:59:52.481778+00"},{"id":"0097dbbd-e846-4722-a586-320f0c7c07d1","book_id":"bfa895db-b4dd-457f-b94c-d8809efb9c6b","chunk_index":28,"content":"The result of the operation of these joint factors may be traced in the market movements of any class of security desired. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider their effect in producing the market swings of the highest grade of investment issues and of the lowest grade, those which are affected only by money rates and those which are affected almost wholly by business conditions. Emerging from the strain of the crisis at their lowest point, high-grade bonds, such as the best municipal and railroad issues, advance rapidly as interest rates decline, continuing their advancing tendency throughout the period of business depression which follows upon the heels of the crisis. As business conditions improve, their position, while perfectly secure before, is further strengthened and an added stimulus is given to their rise. About the middle of the cycle when the business outlook is very promising, and before interest rates have sustained any material advance, the prices of high-grade bonds are usually at their highest point. From that time forward they commence to decline, in spite of the increasing prosperity of the country, under the influence of rising money rates. They make their lowest prices in the midst of the crisis, when the strain upon capital is greatest and the outlook for business most unpromising. The lowest grade of bonds, on the other hand (whose margin of security is least), do not commence to recover materially in price, in spite of the influence of low money rates during the hard times which follow the crisis, the influence of reduced earnings and the fear of default of interest holding them in check. As the outlook becomes brighter, they advance rapidly and continue to improve in price so long as they yield more than current money rates. At some point, difficult to determine in advance but usually well along toward the end of the cycle, they reach their high point and thereafter decline under the influence of the growing stringency in money. Between these two extremes, every class of security is to be found. The better ones will tend to resemble, in their market movements, the course pursued by the choicest bonds; the poorer ones will approximate the lowest class. In every case, however, unless special influences operate to produce variations, the market swing of a given security should be easily conjectured by an investor who gives careful attention to the relative weight which is likely to attach to each determining influence.

I have heard tell that when the knight goeth to the war, and hath overcome his foes by the shearing of swords and guileful tricks, and hath come back home to his own folk, they praise him and bless him, and crown him with flowers, and boast of him before God in the minster for his deliverance of friend and folk and city. Why shouldst thou be worse to me than this? Now is all said, my dear and my friend 5 farewell, farewell! He goeth toward the house. Therewith she turned and went her ways toward the house in all speed, but making somewhat of a compass. And when she was gone, Walter knelt down and kissed the place where her feet had been, and arose thereafter, and made his way toward the house, he also, but slowly, and staying oft on his way, 113 CHAPTER XVII OF THE HOUSE AND THE PLEASANCE IN THE WOOD. Walter goeth into the woods, WN the morrow morning Walter loitered a while about the house till the mom was grown old, and then about noon he took his bow and arrows and went into the woods to the northward, to get him some venison. He went somewhat far ere he shot him a fawn, and then he sat him down to rest under the shade of a great chestnut tree, for it was not far past the hottest of the day. He looked around thence and saw below him a little dale with a pleasant stream running through it, and he bethought him of bathing therein, so he went down and had his pleasure of the water and the willowy banks 5 for he lay naked a while on the grass by the lip of 114 The Lady is here. the water, for joy of the flickering shade, and the little breeze that ran over the down-long ripples of the stream. Then he did on his rai- ment, and began to come his ways up the bent, but had scarce gone three steps ere he saw a woman coming toward him from down- stream. His heart came into his mouth when he saw her, for she stooped and reached down her arm, as if she would lay her hand on her ankle, so that at first he deemed it had been the Maid, but at the second eye-shot he saw that it was the Mistress. She stood still and looked on him, so that he deemed she would have him come to her. So he went to meet her, and grew somewhat shamefaced as he drew nigher, and wondered at her, for now was she clad but in one garment of some dark gray silky stuflF, embroidered with, as it were, a garland of flowers about the middle, but which was so thin that, as the wind drifted it from side and limb, it hid her no more, but for the said garland, than if water were running over her: her face was full of smiling joy and content as she spake to him in a kind, caressing voice, and said: I give thee good day, good Squire, and well art thou met. And she held out her hand to him. He knelt down before her and kissed it, and abode still upon his knees, and hanging 115 Walter is abashed-, down his head. But she laughed outright, and stooped down to him, and put her hands to his arms, and raised him up, and said to him: What is this, my Squire, that thou kneelest to me as to an idol? He said falter- ing: I wot notj but perchance thou art an idol 5 and I fear thee. What! she said, more than yesterday, whenas thou sawest me afraid? Said he: Yea, for that now I see thee un- hidden, and meseemeth there hath been none such since the old days of the Gentiles. She said: Hast thou not yet bethought thee of a gift to crave of me, a reward for the slaying of mine enemy, and the saving of me from death? O my Lady, he said, even so much would I have done for any other lady, or, forsooth, for any poor man; for so my man- hood would have bidden me. Speak not of gifts to me then. Moreover (and he reddened therewith, and his voice faltered), didst thou not give me my sweet reward yesterday? What more durst I ask?","page_number":120,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 789, \"characters\": 3931}","created_at":"2025-10-17 17:59:43.582279+00"},{"id":"009d29eb-2094-40f0-894d-1b080f810ee2","book_id":"d058ed27-bab3-496d-bf36-bb9281bc6249","chunk_index":85,"content":"That the risk must be taken was a foregone conclusion, but how to keep the engines running at that high speed without attention—for it was evident that no man could live for many minutes in the poisonous fumes—was a more difficult problem. This was solved, however, by the second engineer volunteering to go below with a life-line attached, so that he could be hauled up to the deck when giddiness came on. More than once this gallant petty officer had to be pulled up choking and exhausted. He risked instant death from the explosion of the gas from the leaking and overheated pipes and engines, as well as suffocation from the fumes, but he stuck to his post, returning again and again into the poisonous atmosphere. Darkness was gradually settling over the sea, and the flickering light of the Morse lamp—still asking for a reply—made yellow streaks on the wet fore-deck. Presently a faint speck of light blinked amid the dark mass of the airship, but almost instantly went out, and for some time nothing further was seen. Barely three miles of heaving sea separated the two ships when the bright glare of a Very's light, fired from a pistol, soared into the air. A cheer broke from the dark figures on the deck of the M.L., and a message of hope was eagerly flashed back. The last knot seemed a voyage in itself, but eventually the great dark mass of the still floating envelope loomed up ahead, and almost instantly the clang of the engine-room telegraph, shutting off the leaky engine, gave relief to the plucky second engineer, who had retained consciousness and control through that dreadful twenty minutes by frequently filling his aching lungs above the hatchway. The sea around was a mass of tangled wires, in which the mast and rigging of the M.L. was the first to become entangled. Near approach was impossible, so orders were given to lower away the boat. The sturdy little steel-built life-boat splashed into the sea alongside, one minute rising on a wave high above the deck-line and the next disappearing into the dark void below. Figures slid down the miniature falls to man her and the next minute were pulling through the tangled wreckage to where the beam of the M.L.'s searchlight showed six airmen clinging to a floating but upturned cupola. Numbed with the cold, they fell rather than jumped into the boat as it was pulled alongside. One was insensible and the others were too far gone to utter a word. Nothing but the wonderful vitality necessary to the airman as to the sailor had enabled them to hold on in that bitter cold for over two hours after eight hours in the air. The task of extricating the M.L. from the tangle of wire stays and other wreckage was a difficult one. A propeller had entwined itself and become useless (afterwards freed by going astern), the little signal topmast and yard had been broken off by a loop of wire from the gigantic envelope and the ensign staff carried away. After about twenty minutes cutting and man[oe]uvring, however, she floated free, and a question was raised as to the possibility of salving the airship. By this time another M.L., sent out to assist in the work of rescue, had arrived on the scene, and a conference between the air and sea officers on the senior ship resulted in the attempt at salving being made. Wires that were hanging from the nose of the airship were made fast to the stern of the M.L.'s, and all wreckage was, where possible, cut adrift. This, to the uninitiated, may sound a comparatively quick and simple operation, but when it is performed in the darkness, with the doubtful aid of two small searchlights, on a sea rising and falling under the influence of a heavy ground swell, it is anything but an easy or rapid operation, and occupied half the night. The huge mass of the modern airship towered above the little patrol boats like some leviathan of the deep. To attempt its towage over twenty miles of sea seemed almost ludicrous for such small craft, and yet so light and easy of passage was this aerial monster that progress at the rate of three knots an hour was made when once the wreckage had been cut adrift, the weights released and the envelope had risen off the surface of the water. Armed trawlers that passed in the night wondered if it was a captive zeppelin and winked out inquiries from their Morse lamps. A destroyer came out of the darkness to offer assistance.","page_number":208,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 773, \"characters\": 4382}","created_at":"2025-10-15 04:40:57.97962+00"},{"id":"009dafb1-c1a3-4a8c-9eb5-2a65c4b0712c","book_id":"62452d2e-e9fb-43b5-9f37-11577b94aefd","chunk_index":29,"content":"Look! Isn't it a beauty?—all trimmed with gold lace and spangles.\" Dorothy examined the costume with appreciation, but shook her head ruefully. \"You don't imagine that would meet round my waist?\" she enquired. \"It looks about eighteen inches. For whom was it made?\" \"Mother, before she was married. I always tell her, girls must have been like wasps in those days. Try the Cavalier's. Oh, I don't believe you can wear that either! You're so big! I wish I could lop a little off you. Can't you possibly squeeze into this?\" \"I would if I could, but no—I'm several sizes too large. Haven't you anything else?\" \"Not so nice. These are quite the best. You see, they're made of really good materials, and the others are only of glazed calico and sateen. I'll tell you how we'll manage. We must put several costumes together. Take off your coat and hat and I'll show you. Now, if you have the mediaeval dress on first, we can tuck the bodice inside, and drape the Cavalier's cloak like a pannier to cover the waist. The Norwegian bodice goes quite well with it, and that's big enough, at any rate. Now this gauze scarf round your shoulder, and this big hat, and there you are. Oh, it's lovely!\" \"What am I intended to be?\" asked Dorothy, looking down at her miscellaneous finery. \"A Venetian lady in the time of the Doges. It is after the picture in the drawing-room. Oh, it is like! It's simply splendid—you've no idea how good!\" \"What picture?\" \"The portrait of Aunt Madeleine in fancy dress. Why, Dorothy, you're just the living image of it! Come downstairs at once and let me show you. It's perfect.\" Quite carried away by her own enthusiasm, Alison dragged Dorothy along the landing, the latter much encumbered by her long skirt and the necessity for holding on most of the articles of her attire. \"Don't go so fast,\" she implored; \"I'm losing the pannier, and the hat's nearly bobbing off. If you'll hold the train behind, I may manage better.\" \"All right; but then I can't see you—the back view isn't nearly so nice. This way—I have to steer you like a ship. Here's the drawing-room. Now, take a good look in the glass first, and then please admire the picture.\" The face that greeted Dorothy in the mirror was the prettiest version of herself that she had ever seen. The quaint costume, the scarf, and the big hat suited her admirably; the excitement and fun had brought unwonted roses to her cheeks, and her eyes were as bright as stars. She had had no idea that it was possible for her to look so well, and the surprise heightened the colour which was so becoming. \"Now the picture—look straight from yourself to the picture!\" commanded Alison. The portrait hanging on the opposite wall was that of a young lady of perhaps seventeen. The face was pretty, with grey eyes and regular features; the splendid Venetian dress set off to advantage the dark curls and the graceful turn of the neck; the slender hands held a lute, and the lips looked as if they had just closed after finishing the last refrain of a song. Whether it was the effect of the costume or not, there certainly was some resemblance between the face in the painting and that of the girl who was scrutinizing it. Dorothy could see that for herself, though the likeness did not seem so striking to her as it appeared to her friend. \"You're the absolute image!\" declared Alison. \"It might have been painted directly from you. Bruce!\" (to a servant who was crossing the hall) \"Bruce, come here! I want you to look. Did you ever see anything so exact? Isn't she Aunt Madeleine to the life?\" Bruce gazed contemplatively from the painted face to the living one. \"The young lady certainly favours the picture,\" she said. \"I suppose it's the dress, and the way her hair's done. Miss Alison, your tea's ready. I've put it in the library this afternoon.\" \"Then bring another cup. Dorothy, you must stay and have tea with me. Yes, you must! You don't know how I hate being alone, and Mother won't be home till seven. Oh, do, do! You can't think how much I want you.\" \"But I shall miss the 5.30!\" \"Never mind, you'll get the next train. Isn't there one at six? Bruce, fetch the railway guide please. Oh, thanks! Now then, Coleminster to Hurford—where are we? Latchworth—yes, there's one at 6.5. Dorothy, you'll have oceans of time. I can't let you go without tea.\" It seemed a pity, when she was there, not to stay, so Dorothy argued.","page_number":67,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 789, \"characters\": 4391}","created_at":"2025-07-19 09:08:24.890778+00"},{"id":"009e8f33-884d-4998-95fd-3c3c863b569b","book_id":"f768937a-b2a4-47c7-9818-48e3ba8caeef","chunk_index":34,"content":"Following the talks we just visited together and gos- siped for an hour or two, enjoying the rare treat of being able to speak our minds freely and fearlessly. I had to re-tell several times my experiences before Or-tis’s new court-martial and I know that it was with difficulty that they believed that I had said the things I had to our masters and come away free and alive. They simply could not understand it. All were warned of Peter Johansen and the names of others under suspicion of being informers were passed around that we might all be on our guard against them. We did not sing again, for even on these days that our hearts were lightest they were too heavy for song. About two o’clock the pass signal for the next meeting was given out and then we started away singly or in pairs. I volunteered to go last, with Juana, and see that the door was locked. 7s EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS An hour later we started out, about five minutes behinds Samuels the Jew. Juana’s mother had passed down to her by word of mouth an unusually complete religious training for those days and she, in turn, had transmitted it to Juana. It seemed that they, too, had had a church in their district; but that a short time before it had been discovered by the authorities and destroyed, though none of the members of the organization had been apprehended. So close a watch was kept thereafter that they had never dared seek another meeting place. She told me that their congregation was much like ours in personnel and with the knowledge she had of ancient religious customs it always seemed odd to her to see so different creeds worshiping under one roof in even greater harmony than many denominations of the same church knew in ancient times. Among us were descendants of Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic and Jew that I knew of and how many more I did not know, nor did any of us care. We worshipped an ideal and a great hope, both of which were all goodness, and we called these God. We did not care what our great-grandfathers thought about it or what some one a thousand years before had thought or done or what name they had given the Supreme Being, for we knew that there could be but one and whether we called Him one thing or another would not alter Him in any way. This much good, at least, the Kalkars had accomplished in the world; but it had come too late. Those who worshiped any god were becoming fewer and fewer. Our own con- gregation had fallen from twenty-two a year or so before to fifteen—until Juana made us sixteen. Some had died natural deaths and some had gone to the mines or the butcher; but the principal reason of our — 78 THE MOON MEN decadence was the fact that there were too few children to take the place of the adults who died—that and our fear to seek converts. We were dying out, there was no doubt of it, and with us was dying all religion. That was what the lunar theory was doing for the world; but it was only what any one might have expected. Intelligent men and women realized it from almost the instant that this lunar theory stuck its ugly head above our horizon—a political faith that would make all women the common property of all men could not by any remote possibility have respect, or even aught but fear, for any religion of ancient times, and the Kalkars did, just what any one might have known they would do—they deliberately and openly crushed all churches. Juana and I had emerged from the wood when we noticed a man walking cautiously in the shade of the trees ahead of us. He seemed to be following some one and immediately there sprang to my thoughts the ever near suspicion—spy . The moment that he turned a bend in the pathway and was out of our sight Juana and I ran forward as rapidly as. we could go that we might get a closer view of him, nor were we disappointed. We saw him and recognized him and we also saw whom he shadowed. It was Peter Johan- sen, Carrying one arm in a sling, sneaking along behind Samuels. I knew that if Peter was permitted to shadow Samuels home he would discover the devious way the old man followed and immediately, even though he had sus- picioned nothing in particular before, he would know that Moses had been upon some errand that he didn’t wish the authorities to learn of.","page_number":78,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 789, \"characters\": 4272}","created_at":"2025-10-27 17:20:25.805724+00"},{"id":"00a1d0a2-3713-471d-921d-e4476c857912","book_id":"d431e0f5-c861-4af3-b9a7-7a8c59d45c67","chunk_index":76,"content":"And why is he thy tyrant, that thou must flee from him?” She laughed and said: “Fair creature, he is my husband.” Then Ralph flushed red, and his visage clouded, and he opened his mouth to speak; but she stayed him and said: “Yet is he not so much my husband but that or ever we were bedded he must needs curse me and drive me away from his house.” And she smiled, but her face reddened so deeply that her grey eyes looked strange and light therein. But Ralph leapt up, and half drew his sword, and cried out loud: “Would God I had slain him! Wherefore could I not slay him?” And he strode up and down the sward before her in his wrath. But she leaned forward to him and laughed and said: “Yet, O Champion, we will not go back to him, for he is stronger than thou, and hath vanquished thee. This is a desert place, but thou art loud, and maybe over loud. Come rest by me.” So he came and sat down by her, and took her hand again and kissed the wrist therof and fondled it and said: “Yea, but he desireth thee sorely; that was easy to see. It was my ill-luck that I slew him not.” She stroked his face again and said: “Long were the tale if I told thee all. After he had driven me out, and I had fled from him, he fell in with me again divers times, as was like to be; for his brother is the Captain of the Dry Tree; the tall man whom thou hast seen with me: and every time this baron hath come on me he has prayed my love, as one who would die despaired if I granted it not, but O my love with the bright sword” (and she kissed his cheek therewith, and fondled his hand with both her hands), “each time I said him nay, I said him nay.” And again her face burned with blushes. “And his brother,” said Ralph, “the big captain that I have come across these four times, doth he desire thee also?” She laughed and said: “But as others have, no more: he will not slay any man for my sake.” Said Ralph: “Didst thou wot that I was abiding thy coming at the Castle of Abundance?” “Yea,” she said, “have I not told thee that I bade Roger lead thee thither?” Then she said softly: “That was after that first time we met; after I had ridden away on the horse of that butcher whom thou slayedst.” “But why camest thou so late?” said he; “Wouldst thou have come if I had abided there yet?” She said: “What else did I desire but to be with thee? But I set out alone looking not for any peril, since our riders had gone to the north against them of the Burg: but as I drew near to the Water of the Oak, I fell in with my husband and that other man; and this time all my naysays were of no avail, and whatsoever I might say he constrained me to go with them; but straightway they fell out together, and fought, even as thou sawest.” And she looked at him sweetly, and as frankly as if he had been naught but her dearest brother. But he said: “It was concerning thee that they fought: hast thou known the Black Knight for long?” “Yea,” she said, “I may not hide that he hath loved me: but he hath also betrayed me. It was through him that the Knight of the Sun drave me from him. Hearken, for this concerneth thee: he made a tale of me of true and false mingled, that I was a wise-wife and an enchantress, and my lord trowed in him, so that I was put to shame before all the house, and driven forth wrung with anguish, barefoot and bleeding.” He looked and saw pain and grief in her face, as it had been the shadow of that past time, and the fierceness of love in him so changed his face, that she arose and drew a little way from him, and stood there gazing at him. But he also rose and knelt before her, and reached up for her hands and took them in his and said: “Tell me truly, and beguile me not; for I am a young man, and without guile, and I love thee, and would have thee for my speech-friend, what woman soever may be in the world.

But yes ter-morn ? whose house was so great, so flourishing as Manfred's?-—where is young Conrad now!—my Lord, I respect your tears—but I mean not to check them—let them flow, Prince! they will weigh more with heaven to¬ ward the welfare of thy subjects, than a marriage, which, founded on lust or policy, could never prosper. The see- 86 pter, which passed from the race of Alfonso to thine , cannot be preserved by a match which the church will ne¬ ver allow. If it is the will of the most High that Manfred!s name must perish, resign yourself, my Lord, to its decrees; and thus deserve a crown that can ne¬ ver pass away.—Come, my Lord;I like this sorrow — let us return to the Prin¬ cess: She is not apprized of your cruel intentions; nor did I mean more than to alarm you. You saw with what gen¬ tle patience, with what efforts of love, she heard, she rejected hearing the extent of your guilt. I know she longs to fold you in her arms, and assure you of her unalterable affection. Father, said the Prince, you mistake my com¬ punction: true; I honour Hippolita's virtues; I think her a Saint; and wish it were for my soul’s health to tie faster the knot that has united us—but alas! Father, you know not the bitterest of my pangs! it is some time that I have had scruples on the legality of our union: Hippolita is related to me in the fourth degree-—it is true, we had a dispensation: But I have been infor¬ med that she had also been contracted to another. This it is that sits heavy at my heart: To this state of unlawful Wedlock I impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad!— ease my conscience of this burden: dis¬ solve our marriage, and accomplish the work of godliness which your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul. How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when he perceived this turn in the wily Prince! He trem¬ bled for Hippolita, whose ruin he saw was determined; and he feared if Man¬ fred had no hope of recovering Isabel- 88 la, that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other object, who might not be equally proof against the temptation of Manfred's rank. For so¬ me time the holy man remained absor¬ bed in thought. At length, conceiving some hopes from delay, he thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of recovering Isabella. Her the Friar knew he could dispose, from her affection to Hippoli- ta 2 and from the aversion she had ex¬ pressed to him for Manfred's addresses, to second his views, till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce. With this intention, as if struck with the Prince’s scruples, he at length said; My Lord, I have been pondering on what your Highness has said; and if in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to Scj endeavour to harden your heart. The church is an indulgent mother : unfold your griefs to her: she alone can admi¬ nister comfort to your soul., either by satisfying your conscience, or upon exa¬ mination of your scruples, by setting you at liberty, and indulging you in the law¬ ful means of continuing your lineage. In the latter case, if the Lady Isabella can be brought to consent—Manfred j who concluded that he had either over-rea¬ ched the good man, or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance, was overjoyed at his sud¬ den turn, and repeated the most magni¬ ficent promises, if he should succeed by the Friar’s mediation. The well-meaning Priest suffered him to deceive himself, fully determined to traverse his views, instead of seconding them . Since we now understand one ano¬ ther , resumed the Prince, I expect. go Father 5 that you satisfy me in one point. Who is the youth that I found in the vault? He must have been privy to Isabella's flight: Tell me truly; is he her lover? or is he an agent for ano¬ ther’s passion? I have often suspected Isabella's indifference to my son: a thous¬ and circumstances croud on my mind that confirm that suspicion.

Four Stories About Dear, Dear Eyes People : The White Horse Girl The Blue Wind Boy The Gray Man on Horseback Six Girls With Balloons Henry Hagglyhoagly Susan Slackentwist Two Wool Yarn Mittens Peter Potato Blossom Wishes Her Father Many Shoes Slippers A Slipper Moon The White Horse Girl and the Blue Wind Boy When the dishes are washed at night time and the cool of the evening has come in summer or the lamps and fires are lit for the night in winter, then the fathers and mothers in the Rootabaga Country sometimes tell the young people the story of the White Horse Girl and the Blue Wind Boy. The White Horse Girl grew up far in the west of the Rootabaga Country. All the years she grew up as a girl she liked to ride horses. Best of all things for her was to be straddle of a white horse loping with a loose bridle among the hills and along the rivers of the west Rootabaga Country. She rode one horse white as snow, another horse white as new washed sheep wool, and another white as silver. And she could not tell because she did not know which of these three white horses she liked best. “Snow is beautiful enough for me any time,” she said, “new washed sheep wool, or silver out of a ribbon of the new moon, any or either is white enough for me. I like the white manes, the white flanks, the white noses, the white feet of all my ponies. I like the forelocks hanging down between the white ears of all three— my ponies.” And living neighbor to the White Horse Girl in the same prairie country, with the same black crows flying over their places, was the Blue Wind Boy. All the years he grew up as a boy he liked to walk with his feet in the dirt and the grass listening to the winds. Best of all things for him was to put on strong shoes and go hiking among the hills and along the rivers of the west Rootabaga Country, listening to the winds. There was a blue wind of day time, starting sometimes six o’clock on a summer morning or eight o’clock on a winter morning. And there was a night wind with blue of summer stars in summer and blue of winter stars in winter. And there was yet another, a blue wind of the times between night and day, a blue dawn and evening wind. All three of these winds he liked so well he could not say which he liked best. “The early morning wind is strong as the prairie and whatever I tell it I know it believes and remembers,” he said, “and the night wind with the big dark curves of the night sky in it, the night wind gets inside of me and understands all my secrets. And the blue wind of the times between, in the dusk when it is neither night nor day, this is the wind that asks me questions and tells me to wait and it will bring me whatever I want.” Of course, it happened as it had to happen, the White Horse Girl and the Blue Wind Boy met. She, straddling one of her white horses, and he, wearing his strong hiking shoes in the dirt and the grass, it had to happen they should meet among the hills and along the rivers of the west Rootabaga Country where they lived neighbors. And of course, she told him all about the snow white horse and the horse white as new washed sheep wool and the horse white as a silver ribbon of the new moon. And he told her all about the blue winds he liked listening to, the early morning wind, the night sky wind, and the wind of the dusk between, the wind that asked him questions and told him to wait. One day the two of them were gone. On the same day of the week the White Horse Girl and the Blue Wind Boy went away.","page_number":63,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 779, \"characters\": 4001}","created_at":"2025-08-19 14:45:57.10765+00"},{"id":"00a5e134-1ebb-4b37-aea5-5fa02d548ddb","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":277,"content":"If the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him, I’ll be hang’d; it could not be else: I have drunk medicines.— Poins!—Hal!—a plague upon you both!—Bardolph!—Peto!—I’ll starve, ere I’ll rob a foot further.

Harvey's old clothes and Mary's and the children's, things that any right-minded person would 'a' put in the rag- bag or given away to anybody that could make use of 'em; there they was, all hoarded up in that old room jest like they was of some value. And over in one corner was all the old worn-out tin things that you could think of: buckets and pans and milk-strainers and dippers and cups. And next to them was all the glass and china that'd been broken in the years Mary and Harvey'd been keepin' house. And there was a lot of old brooms, nothin' but stubs, tied together jest like new brooms in the store. And there was all the children's broken toys, dolls, and doll dresses, and even some glass marbles that little Harvey used to play with. The dust was lyin' thick and heavy over everything, and the spiderwebs looked like black strings hangin' from the ceilin'; but things of the same sort was all lyin' together jest like some woman had put the place in order. \"You've heard tell of that bird, child, that gathers up all sorts o' rubbish and carries it off to its nest and hides it? Well, I thought about that bird; and the heap of old iron reminded me of a little boy's pocket when you turn it wrong side out at night, and the china and glass and doll-rags made me think of the playhouses I used to make under the trees when I was a little girl. I've seen many curious places, honey, but nothin' like that old cabin. The moldy smell reminded me of the grave; and when I looked at all the dusty, old plunder, the ragged clothes hangin' against the wall like so many ghosts, and then thought of the dead man that had put 'em there, I tell you it made my flesh creep. \"Well, we stood there, me and Mary, strainin' our eyes tryin' to see into the dark corners, and all at once the meanin' of it come over me like a flash: Harvey was a miser! \" Aunt Jane stopped, took off her glasses and polished them on the hem of her gingham apron. I sat holding my breath; but, all regardless of my suspense, she dropped the thread of the story and followed memory in one of her capricious backward flights. \"I ricollect a sermon I heard when I was a gyirl,\" she said. \"It ain't often, I reckon, that a sermon makes much impression on a gyirl's mind. But this wasn't any ordinary sermon or any ordinary preacher. Presbytery met in town that year, and all the big preachers in the state was there. Some of 'em come out and preached to the country churches, and old Dr. Samuel Chalmers Morse preached at Goshen. He was one o' the biggest men in the Presbytery, and I ricollect his looks as plain as I ricollect his sermon. Some preachers look jest like other men, and you can tell the minute you set eyes on 'em that they ain't any wiser or any better than common folks. But Dr. Morse wasn't that kind. \"You know the Bible tells about people walkin' with God and talkin' with God. It says Enoch walked with God, and Adam talked with Him. Some folks might find that hard to believe, but it seems jest as natural to me. Why many a time I've been in my gyarden when the sun's gone down, and it ain't quite time for the moon to come up, and the dew's fallin' and the flowers smellin' sweet, and I've set down in the summer-house and looked up at the stars; and if I'd heard a voice from heaven it wouldn't 'a' been a bit stranger to me than the blowin' of the wind. \"The minute I saw Dr. Morse I thought about Adam and Enoch, and I said to myself, 'He looks like a man that's walked with God and talked with God.' \"I didn't look at the people's hats and bonnets that day half as much as I usually did, and part of that sermon stayed by me all my life. He preached about Nebuchadnezzar and the image he saw in his dream with the head of gold and the feet of clay. And he said that every human being was like that image; there was gold and there was clay in every one of us.

These pods burst open when they are ripe; and you can see the fluffy white cotton bulging all white out of the pods. There was a Thrush in this garden, and the Thrush thought within herself how nice and soft the cotton looked. She plucked out some of it to line her nest with; and never before was her sleep so soft as it was on that bed of cotton. Now this Thrush had a clever head; so she thought something more might be done with cotton besides lining a nest. In her flights abroad she used often to pass by the door of a Cotton-carder. The Cotton-carder had a thing like a bow, made of a piece of wood, and a thong of leather tying the ends together into a curve. He used to take the cotton, and pile it in a heap; then he took the carding- bow, and twang-twang-twanged it among the heap of cotton, so that the fibres or threads of it became disentangled. Then he rolled it up into oblong balls, and sold it to other people, who made it into thread. The Thrush often watched the Cotton-carder at work. Every day after dinner, she went to the cotton tree, and plucked out a fluff of cotton in her beak and hid it away. She went on doing this till at last she had quite a little heap of cotton all of her own. At least, it was not really her own, because she stole it; but then you cannot get policemen to take up a Thrush for stealing, and as men catch Thrushes and put them in a cage all for nothing, it is only fair the birds should have their turn. When the heap of cotton was big enough, our Thrush flew to the house of the Cotton-carder, and sat down in front of him. \"Good day, Man,\" said the Thrush. \"Good day, Birdie,\" said the Cotton-carder. The Thrush was not a bit afraid, because she knew he was a kind man, who never caught little birds to put them in a cage. He liked better to hear them singing free in the woods. \"Man,\" said the Thrush, \"I have a heap of beautiful cotton, and I'll tell you what. You shall have half of it, if you will card the rest and make it up into balls for me.\" \"That I will,\" said the man; \"where is it?\" \"If you will come with me,\" said the Thrush, \"I'll show you.\" So the Thrush flew in front, and the man followed after, and they came to the place where the hoard of cotton was hidden away. The man took the cotton home, and carded it, and made it into balls. Half of the cotton he took for his trouble, and the rest he gave back to the Thrush. He was so honest that he did not cheat even a bird, although he could easily have done so. For birds cannot count: and if you find a nest full of eggs, and take one or two, the mother-bird will never miss them; but if you take all, the bird is unhappy. Not far away from the Carder lived a Spinner. This man used to put a ball of cotton on a stick, and then he pulled out a bit of the cotton without breaking it, and tied it to another little stick with a weight on it. Then he twisted the weight, and set it a-spinning; and as it span, he held the cotton ball in one hand, and pulled out the cotton with the other, working it between finger and thumb to keep it fine. Thus the spindle went on spinning, and the cotton went on twisting, until it was twisted into thread. That is why the man was called a Spinner. It looks very easy to do, when you can do it; but it is really very hard to do well. To this Spinner the Thrush came, and after bidding him good day, said she— \"Mr. Spinner, I have some balls of cotton all ready to spin into thread. Will you spin one half of them into thread for me, if I give you the other half?\" \"That I will,\" said Mr. Spinner; and away they went to find the cotton balls, Thrush first and Spinner following. In a very few days the Spinner had spun all the cotton into the finest thread. Then he took a pair of scales, and weighed it into two equal parts (he was an honest man, too): half he kept for himself, and the other half he gave to the Thrush.","page_number":14,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 792, \"characters\": 3961}","created_at":"2025-10-28 04:15:17.854138+00"},{"id":"00aac5df-93e3-43cc-a09e-55b7f9d1953f","book_id":"126bb31e-fdc7-4a16-81c1-1c39839b58ad","chunk_index":29,"content":"But I bought there a little illustrated book called the Château de Versailles , which interested me so extremely that I decided that, on some reasonable opportunity, I would go and visit the place. V.—Paris at Night \"W HAT Ah'd like to do,\" says the Fat Lady from Georgia, settling back comfortably in her seat after her five-dollar dinner at the Café American, while her husband is figuring whether ten francs is enough to give to the waiter, \"is to go and see something real wicked. Ah tell him (the word 'him' is used in Georgia to mean husband) that while we're here Ah just want to see everything that's going.\" \"All right,\" says the Man from Kansas who \"knows\" Paris, \"I'll get a guide right here, and he'll take us round and show us the sights.\" \"Can you get him heah?\" asks the gentleman from Georgia, looking round at the glittering mirrors and gold cornices of the restaurant. Can you get a guide? Well, now! Can you keep away from them? All day from the dewy hour of breakfast till late at night they meet you in the street and sidle up with the enquiry, \"Guide, sir?\" Where the Parisian guide comes from and how he graduates for his job I do not know. He is not French and, as a rule, he doesn't know Paris. He knows his way to the Louvre and to two or three American bars and to the Moulin Rouge in Montmartre. But he doesn't need to know his way. For that he falls back on the taxi-driver. \"Now, sir,\" says the guide briskly to the gentleman who has engaged his services, \"where would you like to go?\" \"I should like to see Napoleon's tomb.\" \"All right,\" says the guide, \"get into the taxi.\" Then he turns to the driver. \"Drive to Napoleon's tomb,\" he says. After they have looked at it the guide says, \"What would you like to see next, sir?\" \"I am very anxious to see Victor Hugo's house, which I understand is now made open to the public.\" The guide turns to the taxi man. \"Drive to Victor Hugo's house,\" he says. After looking through the house the visitor says in a furtive way, \"I was just wondering if I could get a drink anywhere in this part of the town?\" \"Certainly,\" says the guide. \"Drive to an American bar.\" Isn't that simple? Can you imagine any more agreeable way of earning five dollars in three hours than that? Of course, what the guide says to the taxi man is said in the French language, or in something resembling it, and the gentleman in the cab doesn't understand it. Otherwise, after six or seven days of driving round in this way he begins to wonder what the guide is for. But of course, the guide's life, when you come to think of it, is one full of difficulty and danger. Just suppose that, while he was away off somewhere in Victor Hugo's house or at Napoleon's grave, the taxi-driver were to be struck by lightning. How on earth would he get home? He might, perhaps, be up in the Eiffel Tower and the taxi man get a stroke of paralysis, and then he'd starve to death trying to find his way back. After all, the guide has to have the kind of pluck and hardihood that ought to be well rewarded. Why, in other countries, like Switzerland, they have to use dogs for it, and in France, when these plucky fellows throw themselves into it, surely one wouldn't grudge the nominal fee of five dollars for which they risk their lives. But I am forgetting about the Lady from Georgia and her husband. Off they go in due course from the glittering doors of the restaurant in a huge taxi with a guide in a peaked hat. The party is all animation. The lady's face is aglow with moral enthusiasm. The gentleman and his friend have their coats buttoned tight to their chins for fear that thieves might leap over the side of the taxi and steal their neckties. So they go buzzing along the lighted boulevard looking for \"something real wicked.\" What they want is to see something really and truly wicked; they don't know just what, but \"something bad.\" They've got the idea that Paris is one of the wickedest places on earth, and they want to see it. The lady's face is aglow with moral enthusiasm.

Bear back. First observe the antithesis of quietness in the opening of this speech. It gives us a rest after the vehemence of the past and affords a means of generating a new and greater climax. It takes the action and prepares it for a fuller development. It is not an idle relief by any manner of means. In the general treatment of the speech realize the intention of the various dramatic values deliberately constructed and combined to develop the emotional sympathies of the CROWD in a more intense way. It is an actor's speech, constructed with an eye to effect. It is not merely spoken but felt, and with an observant eye upon those to whom it is addressed. Behind it all is a conscious government over which a mantle of judicious acting is thrown, and a sin- cerity which has purpose in its assumption. Its aim is to augment the pity for C.ESAR which when ripe is transformed to rage by the sudden exposure of the victim. The effect is, as we shall see, the complete weapon for ANTONY'S vengeance. Commence slowly, tenderly and quietly. The notes accompanying this speech can only, at the most, serve to indicate something of its nature. It is beyond the power of such limited commentation adequately to disclose the full qualities of construction that go to its making. To the eye of an instinctive artist it is hoped that the sketch will prove an introduction to the highly skilful combination of technique and art that co-operates in this piece of fine dramatic writing. Beyond that, it has not the power to go. ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

So their honest little brown faces were covered with good-nature and smiles, as they crooned out their information. \"You must walk straight through the wood,\" they said, \"until you come to a waterfall at the beginning of a stream; and you must follow the stream down, down, down, until it brings you to a valley surrounded by high hills; and in that valley is the toyshop of the Wonderful Toymaker, who makes all the toys for Fairyland.\" \"That is simple enough, I 'm sure,\" said Martin. \"Ah,\" said the pine dwarfs, wisely, \"but it is not so easy to get there as you think; for the stream leads you through the country of the people who make conversation, and they try to stop every stranger who passes by, so that they can make him into conversation; and that is why so few people ever reach the Wonderful Toymaker at all.\" \"Make conversation! How funny!\" said Martin; and he almost laughed aloud at the idea. \"It is more sad than funny,\" said the pine dwarfs, sighing like a large gust of wind that for the moment made Martin feel quite chilly; \"for it gives us so much to do. You see, they make conversation, and we make silence; and the more conversation they make the more silence we have to make to keep things even. They are always ahead of us, for all that!\" They sighed again. Martin looked puzzled. \"Still, your silence is so full of sound,\" he said. The pine dwarfs laughed softly, so softly that most people would have called it only smiling. \"Real silence, the best kind, is always full of sound; and of course we only make the very best kind,\" they explained proudly. \"Anybody can make the other kind of silence by taking the air and sifting out the noise in it. Now, we take the air, and when we have sifted out the noise we fill it with sound. That's a very different thing. The worst of it is,\" they added, sadly, \"there is so little demand for real silence. We have layers of it piled up at the top, of those pine trees, and nobody ever wants it. The other silence is so much cheaper, you see, and most people don't know the difference.\" \"When I am grown up and have a house of my own,\" said Martin, \"I shall come and ask you to fill it with the very best silence for me.\" The pine dwarfs shook their little brown heads incredulously. \"Wait till you are grown up,\" they said; \"and then, if you will let us fill one room for you, we shall be quite satisfied. Now, set off on your journey; and if you want to escape being made into conversation, you must not speak a single word until you reach the valley where the Wonderful Toymaker lives.\" \"Trust me!\" laughed Martin. \"It is only talking that is difficult; any one can keep silent.\" \"Very well; be careful, only be careful!\" they sighed; and in another moment they had all gone back to their pine trees, and nothing was to be heard except the distant sounds with which they were filling the silence. Then Martin walked on until he came to the rushing waterfall; and along by the side of the stream he trudged and thought it was the very noisiest stream he had ever come across, for it clattered over the stones, and splashed up in the air, and seemed bent on getting through life with as much fuss and excitement as it was possible to make. As he walked along by its side, he discovered that the noise it made was caused by millions of little voices, chattering and gossiping, quarrelling and laughing, as busily as they could. \"This must be the country where they make conversation,\" thought Martin. \"Well, I must be pretty careful not to let them know I can talk.\" At the same time, the longer he walked by that talkative little stream the easier it was to forget the silence in the pine wood; and he began to think that, after all, one silent room would be quite enough in the house he was going to have some day.","page_number":49,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 744, \"characters\": 3981}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:46:51.098035+00"},{"id":"00baebc4-c088-478b-b9fc-27ae39be7127","book_id":"9270ad77-4fb6-4f18-8246-0612e8b235f6","chunk_index":1051,"content":"If there be Such valour in the bearing, what make we Abroad?

And in they came. Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him, but, careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape, with a red edge to every fold, he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables. To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery. As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream. And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream. At all events, he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then. He opened the door, and passed through the little belt of shrubbery. Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn. Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost. [ 32 | AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND What? Yes! There was one! He ran and knelt down to look ab ite It was a primrose—a dwarfish thing, but perfect in shape —a baby-wonder. As he stooped his face to see it close, a little wind began to blow, and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered, but the primrose lay still in the green hollow, looking up at the sky, and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all. It was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with. All at once Diamond thought it was saying its prayers, and he ought not to be staring at it so. He ran to the stable to see his father make Diamond’s bed. Then his father took him in his arms, car- ried him up the ladder, and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea. **Miss is very poorly,” said Diamond’s father; ‘ Mis’ess has been to the doctor with her to-day, and she looked very glum when she came out again. I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said.” “And didn’t Miss look glum too?” asked his mother. “Not half as glum as Mis’ess,” returned the coachman. “You see——” But he lowered his voice, and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there. For Diamond’s father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at, and one of the best of drivers, but one of the most discreet of servants as well. Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife, whom he had proved better than himself long ago, and was careful that even Diamond [ 33 | AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family. It was bed-time soon, and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep. He awoke all at once, in the dark. “Open the window, Diamond,” said a voice. Now Diamond’s mother had once more pasted up North Wind’s window. “Are you North Wind?” said Diamond: “I don’t hear you blowing.” ““No; but you hear me talking. Open the window, for I haven’t overmuch time.” “Yes,” returned Diamond. “But, please, North Wind, where’s the use? You left me all alone last time.” He had got up on his knees, and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall.","page_number":38,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 646, \"characters\": 3279}","created_at":"2025-10-15 04:41:56.404918+00"},{"id":"00bc5901-bbd8-45be-873c-710de533c30b","book_id":"5a54a917-63f3-4401-bc01-bf4f6f657662","chunk_index":41,"content":"He has been running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.

How many days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?” “We had better not talk about it, my dear,” replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly; “for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together. I had known you by character, however, long before.” “Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides? I do not like having such things so long in hand. I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch. Then there would always be company for them. And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other.” “Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,” said Mrs Croft, in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; “and a very respectable family. One could not be connected with better people. My dear Admiral, that post! we shall certainly take that post.” But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage. 7/19/25, 4:16 AM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Persuasion | Project Gutenberg https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/105/pg105-images.html 42/115 CHAPTER XI. The time now approached for Lady Russell’s return: the day was even fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it. It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families. This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell. She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere. They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little. These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough. Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months’ visit there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for. The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined. Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away. A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville’s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other. Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth’s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme. He had been there for four-and-twenty hours.","page_number":41,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 762, \"characters\": 4358}","created_at":"2025-07-19 11:25:29.735681+00"},{"id":"00bcd473-6403-44f6-ac8e-f671cb5870f7","book_id":"5f5c5292-421e-4ffe-a23c-ed8c3be59758","chunk_index":29,"content":"This is why Anytus so unhesitatingly answers that Themistocles was ‘a good man,’ using the word 2s an eqnivalent for a clever or able man, as in the slang sense which it carries among ourselves. By ‘virtue’ in fact was meant, in popular parlance, that assemblage of qualities which makes a man a capable statesman. The aim of every ambitious young Greek at this period was to become δυνατὸς λέγειν τε καὶ πράττειν τὰ πολιτικά. The scions of wealthy houses did not mind spending money, if only they could acquire the art whereby men manage hotses and cities well, and become capable of ruling, and of doing good to themselves and others (Xen. Mem. IV. 2. § 11). The demand created the supply (Prot. 318 E), and the class of Sophists arose, professing to be able to teach men ‘virtue.’ It was this claim of the Sophists which led Socrates to raise the previous question, whether virtue could be taught. πειραστικός} 1.6. tentative. This term belongs to an elaborate 4 MENO, NOTES. 70 A. philosophical division of the works of Plato, which has been pre- served to us by Diogenes Laertius (III. §§ 49-51), but which was certainly not devised by himself. Grote (Plato, vol. I. p. 160 note) thinks it ‘certain’ that he borrowed it from Thrasyllus, to whom the division into tetralogies is ascribed. But the division into tetralogies itself may not have been the work of Thrasyllus. Albinus, the author of an ‘ Introduction to the Dialogues of Plato’ (printed in Hermann’s Appendix Platonica), and a contemporary of Galen (born about A. Ὁ. 130), after speaking of the division into tetralogies, adds ‘ of this opinion are Dercyllides and Thrasyllus.’ Thrasyllus, then, is not necessarily the author of the division into tetralogies with which his name has been coupled by Diogenes (III. 56). For the philosophical division, into which the term πειραστικός enters as one of the dividing members, see the scheme prefixed. It embraces several works which modern critics regard as spurious, ἔχεις μοι εἰπεῖν, «.7.A.] Contrary to his general habit, Plato, in this dialogue, plunges straight into the discussion. But the omission of an introduction, in which the Meno resembles the Cratylus, Phile- bus, Hipparchus, and Minos, is more apparent than real, since the first two pages (70-71 D) effectively set before us the personality of Meno. The same question which is here propounded is touched on in the Nicomachaean Ethics in connection with happiness, in which virtue is infinitely the most important ingredient. The ninth chapter of the first book of that treatise commences thus: Ὅθεν καὶ ἀπορεῖται πότερόν ἐστι μαθητὸν ἢ ἐθιστὸν ἢ ἄλλως πως ἀσκητόν, ἢ κατά τινα θείαν μοῖραν ἢ καὶ διὰ τύχην παραγίνεται. The drift of Aristotle’s dis- cussion is to show that Happiness is the outcome of human effort, and not in any special sense the gift of Heaven—least of all the result of chance. ‘The precise question which forms the subject of the Meno is alluded to as an unsettled one by Aristotle in the tenth book (ch. (9), § 6), where, speaking on the question of how virtue is to be ac- quired, he says, Γίνεσθαι δ᾽ ἀγαθοὺς οἴονται, of μὲν φύσει, of δ᾽ ἔθει, TOA of δὲ διδαχῇ. So far as moral virtue is concerned, Aristotle, while allowing some weight both to nature and teaching, ascribes by far the most important part to training. διδακτόν] The employment of the neuter adjective with a sub- stantive not of the neuter gender imparts a more abstract air to the question. ‘Translate, ‘ Whether virtue is a thing to be taught.’ Cp. Eur. Hipp. 443 (Dindorf) Κύπρις γὰρ ov φορητόν, ἢν πολλὴ fun. ἐφ᾽ ἱππικῇ) On the reputation of the Thessalians for horseman- ship see Laws 625 D; Hipp. Maj. 284 A. ‘Thessaly is a great plain 5 MENO, NOTES. 7OA-C. enclosed by mountains, which adapts it for horses.

Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret of Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over. There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows. And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying. All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills. The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding these vestiges. . . . Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed. I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately. The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached. It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs. I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood reading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about two hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my Daily Chronicle from the newsboy.","page_number":160,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 792, \"characters\": 4407}","created_at":"2025-09-23 04:00:39.608456+00"},{"id":"00be8677-dc58-4e58-b62d-238a346e6ac9","book_id":"a758e9d7-a89e-4cee-b91e-0f83c1b00715","chunk_index":5,"content":"Good night.” And he got back into bed and went fast asleep. When he awoke in the morning, the first thing he saw was Tigger, sitting in front of the glass and looking at himself. “Hallo!” said Pooh. “Hallo!” said Tigger. “I’ve found somebody just like me. I thought I was the only one of them.” 22 HOUSE AT POOH CORNER Pooh got out of bed, and began to explain what a looking-glass was, but just as he was getting to the interesting part, Tigger said: “Excuse me a moment, but there’s something climbing up your table,” and with one loud Worra- worraworraworraworra he jumped at the end of the tablecloth, pulled it to the ground, wrapped himself up in it three times, rolled to the other end of the room, and, after a terrible struggle, got his head into the daylight again, and said cheerfully: “Have I won?” “That’s my tablecloth,” said Pooh, as he began to unwind Tigger. “I wondered what it was,” said Tigger. “It goes on the table and you put things on it.” TIGGER HAS BREAKFAST 23 “Then why did it try to bite me when I wasn’t looking?” “T don’t think it did,” said Pooh. “Tt tried,” said Tigger, “but Iwas too quick for it.’ > Pooh put the cloth back on the table, and he put a large honey-pot on the cloth, and they sat down to breakfast. And as soon as they sat down, Tigger took a large mouthful of honey . . . and he looked up at the ceiling with his head on one side, and made exploring noises with his tongue and consid- ering noises, and what-have-we-got-here noises . . . and then he said in a very decided voice: “Tiggers don’t like honey.” 24 HOUSE AT POOH CORNER “Oh!” said Pooh, and tried to make it sound Sad and Regretful. “I thought they liked everything.” “Everything except honey,” said Tigger. Pooh felt rather pleased about this, and said that, as soon as he had finished his own breakfast, he would take Tigger round to Piglet’s house, and Tigger could try some of Piglet’s haycorns. “Thank you, Pooh,” said Tigger, “because hay- corns is really what Tiggers like best.” So after breakfast they went round to see Piglet, and Pooh explained as they went that Piglet was a Very Small Animal who didn’t like bouncing, and asked Tigger not to be too Bouncy just at first. And Tigger, who had been hiding behind trees and jumping out on Pooh’s shadow when it wasn’t looking, said that Tiggers were only bouncy before breakfast, and that as soon as they had had a few haycorns they became Quiet and Refined. So by and by they knocked at the door of Piglet’s house. “Hallo, Pooh,” said Piglet. “Hallo, Piglet. This is Tigger.” “Oh, is it?” said Piglet, and he edged round to the other side of the table. “I thought Tiggers were smaller than that.” “Not the big ones,” said Tigger. “They like haycorns,” said Pooh, “so that’s what we've come for, because poor Tigger hasn’t had any breakfast yet.” TIGGER HAS BREAKFAST 25 Piglet pushed the bowl of haycorns towards Tigger, and said: “Help yourself,” and then he got close up to Pooh and felt much braver, and said, “So you're Tigger? Well, well!” in a careless sort of voice. But Tigger said nothing because his mouth was full of haycorns. ... After a long munching noise he said: “Fe-ers 0 i a-ors.” And when Pooh and Piglet said “What?” he said “Skoos ee,” and went outside for a moment. When he came back he said firmly: “Tiggers don’t like haycorns.” “But you said they liked everything except honey,” said Pooh. “Everything except honey and haycorns,” ex- plained Tigger. When he heard this Pooh said, “Oh, I see!” and Piglet, who was rather glad that Tiggers didn’t like haycorns, said, ‘“‘What about thistles?” “Thistles,” said Tigger, “is what Tiggers like best.” “Then let’s go along and see Eeyore,” said Piglet. So the three of them went; and after they had walked and walked and walked, they came to the part of the Forest where Eeyore was. “Hallo, Eeyore!” said Pooh. “This is Tigger.” “What is?” said Eeyore. “This,” explained Pooh and Piglet together, and TIGGER HAS BREAKFAST 2? Tigger smiled his happiest smile and said nothing. Eeyore walked all round Tigger one way, and then turned and walked all round him the other way. “What did you say it was?” he asked. “Tigger.” “Ah!” said Eeyore. “He’s just come,” explained Piglet. “Ah!” said Eeyore again.","page_number":34,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 764, \"characters\": 4243}","created_at":"2025-07-27 06:41:29.1006+00"},{"id":"00beb18a-9039-4e6d-bb23-8226fab2510c","book_id":"fa29f869-bebb-4573-b37a-6e6245fb99ce","chunk_index":41,"content":"Three days later the maid of Sira took me to her mistress. “My mother is again very sick,' she said. 'Saddle the two best camels in my husband's herd. Tie on water skins and saddle bags for a long journey. The maid will give thee food at the kitchen tent.' I packed the camels wondering much at the quantity of provisions the maid provided, for the mother dwelt less than a day's journey away. The maid rode the rear camel which followed and I led the camel of my mistress. When we reached her mother's house it was just dark. Sira dismissed the maid and said to me: “Dabasir, hast thou the soul of a free man or the soul of a slave?' “The soul of a free man,' I insisted. “Now is thy chance to prove it.

Go thy own way and may the gods of the desert protect thee for the way is far and barren of food or water.' \"I needed no further urging, but thanked her warmly and was away into the night. I knew not this strange country and had only a dim idea of the direction in which lay Babylon, but struck out bravely across the desert toward the hills. One camel I rode and the other I led. All that night I traveled and all the next day, urged on by the knowledge of the terrible fate that was meted out to slaves who stole their master's property and tried to escape. \"Late that afternoon, I reached a rough country as uninhabitable as the desert. The sharp rocks bruised the feet of my faithful camels and soon they were picking their way slowly and painfully along. I met neither man nor beast and could well understand why they shunned this inhospitable land. \"It was such a journey from then on as few men live to tell of. Day after day we plodded along. Food and water gave out. The heat of the sun was merciless. At the end of the ninth day, I slid from the back of my mount with the feeling that I was too weak to ever remount and I would surely die, lost in this abandoned country. \"I stretched out upon the ground and slept, not waking until the first gleam of daylight. \"I sat up and looked about me.

Then with clearness I realized that if I had the soul of a slave, I should give up, lie down in the desert and die, a fitting end for a runaway slave. \"But if I had the soul of a free man, what then? Surely I would force my way back to Babylon, repay the people who had trusted me, bring happiness to my wife who truly loved me and bring peace and contentment to my parents. “Thy debts are thine enemies who have run thee out of Babylon,' Sira had said.

and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. 6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD. 6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. 6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. 6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. 6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. 6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. 6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. 6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. 6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.","page_number":207,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 867, \"characters\": 4514}","created_at":"2025-10-08 04:11:00.3331+00"},{"id":"00c46944-4bc4-42fb-b2c7-dd6fa71f13d9","book_id":"71b55749-278a-44d3-8021-e57f33f9be08","chunk_index":54,"content":"Higher magnification shewed that the halo was not granular, but very finely reticular; although it exhibited exactly the same red colour as the granules. It was consequently a spongioplasm peculiar to these mast cells.\" The appearance of the mast cells described by Unna may also be artificially produced, by allowing a preparation that is stained with the oxygen containing analogue of thionin, oxamine, to remain for some time in lævulose syrup or watery glycerine. Evidently part of the dyed mast cell substance is dissolved and retained in the immediate neighbourhood. But as Unna possesses great experience of the mast cells and is a complete master of the methods of their demonstration, one must suppose that the halos described by him were preformed, and did not arise during the preparation of the specimen. It must hence be concluded that an analogous process may go on during life, that these halos are the expression of a vital secretion of the substance of the mast cells externally [24] . A condition that Prus has brought forward in the so-called purpura of the horse, is also to be interpreted as a secretory process of the mast cells. He describes young mast cells from the hæmorrhagic foci of the wall of the gut, on the margins of which bodies of various sizes appeared, and which differ essentially from the mast cells themselves by their staining. Nevertheless from their whole configuration and position it is evident that these bodies have arisen in the mast cells themselves; and Prus comes to the conclusion \"t h a t t h e d e g e n e r a t i n g y o u n g m a s t c e l l s s e c r e t e a f l u i d o r s e m i - f l u i d s u b s t a n c e , w h i c h a s a r u l e s e t s o n t h e s u r f a c e o f t h e c e l l s , b u t a l s o , m o r e r a r e l y , i n t h e i r i n t e r i o r.\" Evidence that the substance of the granules is given off externally may sometimes be seen in the polynuclear neutrophil or their analogues. Thus in rabbit's blood in which he had experimentally produced leucocytosis, Hankin found a distinct progressive decrease of the pseudoeosinophil granules on allowing the samples of blood to remain some time in the thermostat. Further in suppurating foci in man, especially when suppuration has lasted long, or the pus has remained for some time in the place in question (Janowski) a rarefaction almost to complete disappearance of the polynuclear neutrophil granules occurs, and is to be explained by a giving up of the granulations to the exterior. These facts and considerations, on the whole, lead then to the conclusion, t h a t i n g e n e r a l t h e g r a n u l e s o f t h e w a n d e r i n g c e l l s a r e d e s t i n e d f o r e x c r e t i o n .

[22] Altmann's freezing process would be similar to the advance always insisted on by Ehrlich. It offers such great technical difficulties, however, that it has up to now been little used. [23] The cause of these misunderstandings is the tinctorially different stages of development of the granules, as we have fully explained above. How little adequate tinctorial differences by themselves are to settle the chemical identity of a granulation, is at once evident on consideration of the granules of other organs.","page_number":106,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 780, \"characters\": 3539}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:07:36.811582+00"},{"id":"00c625c7-d7fa-44c5-a6d7-836f71280f6a","book_id":"c26e175d-87d2-401b-b6f6-b00081f1a5fc","chunk_index":44,"content":"The doctor looked up occasionally to scold and demand room. At last, out of the faint haze of light far up the street, there came the sound of a gong beating rapidly. A monstrous truck loaded to the sky with barrels scurried to one side with marvellous agility. And then the black waggon, with its gleam of gold lettering and bright brass gong, clattered into view, the horse galloping. A young man, as imperturbable almost as if he were at a picnic, sat upon the rear seat. When they picked up the limp body, from which came little moans and howls, the crowd almost turned into a mob. When the ambulance started on its banging and clanging return, they stood and gazed until it was quite out of sight. Some resumed their way with an air of relief. Others still continued to stare after the vanished ambulance and its burden as if they had been cheated, as if the curtain had been rung down on a tragedy that was but half completed; and this impenetrable blanket intervening between a sufferer and their curiosity seemed to make them feel an injustice. MINETTA LANE, NEW YORK. I TS W ORST D AYS HAVE N OW P ASSED A WAY . B UT ITS I NHABITANTS S TILL I NCLUDE M ANY WHOSE D EEDS ARE E VIL . T HE C ELEBRATED R ESORT OF M AMMY R OSS . Minetta Lane is a small and becobbled valley between hills and dingy brick. At night the street lamps, burning dimly, cause the shadows to be important, and in the gloom one sees groups of quietly conversant negroes, with occasionally the gleam of a passing growler. Everything is vaguely outlined and of uncertain identity, unless, indeed, it be the flashing buttons and shield of the policeman on his coast. The Sixth Avenue horse-cars jingle past one end of the lane, and a block eastward the little thoroughfare ends in the darkness of M'Dougall Street. One wonders how such an insignificant alley could get such an assuredly large reputation, but, as a matter of fact, Minetta Lane and Minetta Street, which leads from it southward to Bleecker Street, were, until a few years ago, two of the most enthusiastically murderous thoroughfares in New York. Bleecker Street, M'Dougall Street, and nearly all the streets thereabouts were most unmistakably bad; the other streets went away and hid. To gain a reputation in Minetta Lane in those days a man was obliged to commit a number of furious crimes, and no celebrity was more important than the man who had a good honest killing to his credit. The inhabitants, for the most part, were negroes, and they represented the very worst element of their race. The razor habit clung to them with the tenacity of an epidemic, and every night the uneven cobbles felt blood. Minetta Lane was not a public thoroughfare at this period. It was a street set apart, a refuge for criminals. Thieves came here preferably with their gains, and almost any day peculiar sentences passed among the inhabitants. \"Big Jim turned a thousand last night.\" \"No-Toe's made another haul.\" And the worshipful citizens would make haste to be present at the consequent revel. As has been said, Minetta Lane was then no thoroughfare. A peaceable citizen chose to make a circuit rather than venture through this place, that swarmed with the most dangerous people in the city. Indeed, the thieves of the district used to say: \"Once get in the lane and you're all right.\" Even a policeman in chase of a criminal would probably shy away instead of pursuing him into the lane. The odds were too great against a lone officer. Sailors, and any men who might appear to have money about them, were welcomed with all proper ceremony at the terrible dens of the lane. At departure they were fortunate if they still retained their teeth. It was the custom to leave very little else to them. There was every facility for the capture of coin, from trap-doors to plain ordinary knock-out drops. And yet Minetta Lane is built on the grave of Minetta Brook, where, in olden times, lovers walked under the willows on the bank, and Minetta Lane, in later times, was the home of many of the best families of the town. A negro named Bloodthirsty was perhaps the most luminous figure of Minetta Lane's aggregation of desperadoes. Bloodthirsty supposedly is alive now, but he has vanished from the lane. The police want him for murder. Bloodthirsty is a large negro, and very hideous. He has a rolling eye that shows white at the wrong time, and his neck, under the jaw, is dreadfully scarred and pitted.","page_number":90,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 790, \"characters\": 4434}","created_at":"2025-08-20 11:24:03.622015+00"},{"id":"00c91154-97a4-4bee-a805-b6c48a9cf3a4","book_id":"8273693c-83e8-4081-b242-231331e6fe71","chunk_index":142,"content":"He heard the rustle of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. \"I'm going to look,\" he said. He opened his eyes. Fanny, her long cheeks flushed, her blue eyes shining, was gazing at him. There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on the bench before him. He turned pale. \"No, Fanny,\" he said quickly. \"From us all,\" she answered hastily. 270 SONS AND LOVERS \"No, but \" \"Are they the right sort?\" she asked, rocking herself with delight. \"Jove ! they're the best in the catalogue.\" \"But they're the right sorts?\" she cried. \"They're off the little list I'd made to get when my ship came in.\" He bit his lip. Fanny was overcome with emotion. She must turn the conversation. \"They was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares, all except the Queen of Sheba.\" The Queen of Sheba was Clara. \"And wouldn't she join?\" Paul asked. \"She didn't get the chance; we never told her; we wasn't going to have her bossing this show. We didn't want her to join.\" Paul laughed at the woman. He was much moved. At last he must go. She was very close to him. Suddenly she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him vehemently. \"1 can give you a kiss to-day,\" she said apologetically. \"You've looked so white, it's made my heart ache.\" Paul kissed her, and left her. Her arms were so pitifully thin that his heart ached also. That day he met Clara as he ran downstairs to wash his hands at dinner-time. \"You have stayed to dinner ! \" he exclaimed. It was unusual for her. \"Yes; and I seem to have dined on old surgical-appliance stock. I must go out now, or I shall feel stale india-rubber right through.\" She lingered. He instantly caught at her wish. \"You are going anywhere?\" he asked. They went together up to the Castle. Outdoors she dressed very plainly, down to ugliness; indoors she always looked nice. She walked with hesitating steps alongside Paul, bowing and turning away from him. Dowdy in dress, and drooping, she showed to great disadvantage. He could scarcely recognise her strong form, that seemed to slumber with power. She appeared almost insignificant, drowning her stature in her stoop, as she shrank from the public gaze. The Castle grounds were very green and fresh. Climbing the precipitous ascent, he laughed and chattered, but she was CLARA 271 silent, seeming to brood over something. There was scarcely time to go inside the squat, square building that crowns the bluff of rock. They leaned upon the wall where the cliff runs sheer down to the Park. Below them, in their holes in the sandstone, pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly. Away down upon the boulevard at the foot of the rock, tiny trees stood in their own pools of shadow, and tiny people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous importance. \"You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles, and have a handful of them,\" he said. She laughed, answering: \"Yes; it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us proportionately. The trees are much more significant.\" \"Bulk only,\" he said. She laughed cynically. Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals showed upon the railway-track, whose margin was crowded with little stacks of timber, beside which smoking toy engines fussed. Then the silver string of the canal lay at random among the black heaps. Beyond, the dwellings, very dense on the river flat, looked like black, poisonous herbage, in thick rows and crowded beds, stretching right away, broken now and then by taller plants, right to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across the country. The steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny. Great stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with corn-land, spread to- wards the haze, where the hills rose blue beyond grey. \"It is comforting,\" said Mrs. Dawes, \"to think the town goes no farther. It is only a little sore upon the country yet.\" \"A little scab,\" Paul said. She shivered. She loathed the town. Looking drearily across at the country which was forbidden her, her impassive face, pale and hostile, she reminded Paul of one of the bitter, re- morseful angels. \"But the town's all right,\" he said; \"it's only temporary. This is the crude, clumsy make-shift we've practised on, till we find out what the idea is. The town will come all right.\" The pigeons in the pockets of rock, among the perched bushes, cooed comfortably. To the left the large church of St. Mary rose into space, to keep close company with the Castle, above the heaped rubble of the town.

When the last dulce had been eaten they went out upon the veranda and talked drowsily of minor matters until both nodded in their com- fortable chairs, and finally fell asleep. 290 Talbot of Ursula For a time the heavy dinner locked Talbot 's brain, but finally he began to dream of his youth, and the scenes of which Delfina Carillo had been the heroine were flung from their rusty frames into the hot light of his memory, until he lived again the ecstasy and the anguish of that time. The morning's reminiscences had moved coldly in his mind, but so intense was his vision of the woman he had worshipped that she seemed bathed in light. He awoke suddenly. The Sefiora still slept, and her face was as placid as in consciousness. It was slightly relaxed, but the time had not yet come for the pathetic loss of muscular control. Still, she looked so large and brown and stout that Talbot rose abruptly with an echo of the agony that had returned in sleep, and entered the sala and stood deliberately before the por- trait. It had been painted by an artist of much ability. There was atmosphere behind it, which in the dim room detached it from the canvas; and the curved red mouth smiled, the eyes flashed with the triumph of youth and much conquest, the skin was as white as the moon-flowers in the fields at night. Talbot recalled the night he had taken this woman in his arms not the woman on the ve- randa and involuntarily he raised them to the 291 The Bell in the Fog picture. \"And I thought it was over,\" he mut- tered, with a terrified gasp. \" But I believe I would give my immortal soul and everything I've accomplished in life if she would come out of the frame and the past for an hour and love me.\" \"Whatte you say?\" drawled a gentle voice. \"I fall asleep, no? Si you ring that little bell Marcia bring the chocolate. You find it too hot out here?\" \"Oh, no; I prefer it out-of-doors. It is cooler now, and I like all the air I can get.\" He longed to get away, but he sipped his choc- olate and listened to the domestic details of his four vicarious daughters. The Senora was im- mensely proud of her five grandchildren. Their photographs were all over the house. At six o'clock he shook hands with her and sprang on his horse. Half-way down the avenue he turned his head, as usual. She stood on the veranda still, and smiled pleasantly to him, mov- ing one of her large brown hands a little. He never saw the Senora again. II Talbot was obliged to go to San Francisco a day or two later, and when he returned the Senora was in bed with a severe cold. He sent her a box 292 Talbot of Ursula of books and papers, and another of chocolates, and then forgot her in the excitement of the elec- tions. It was the autumn of the year 1868, and he was an enthusiastic admirer of Grant. He stumped the State for that admirable warrior and indifferent statesman, with the result that his own following increased ; and his interest in poli- tics waxed with each of several notable successes in behalf of the candidate. He finally announced decisively that he should run for Congress at the next elections, and a member of the House of Representatives from his district dying two days later, he was appointed at once to fill the vacant chair. The Sefiora was still in bed with a persistent cold and cough when he left for Washington late in November, but he rode over to leave a good- bye with old Marcia, and ordered a bookseller in San Francisco to send her all the illustrated papers and magazines. She entered his mind but seldom during those interesting months in Washington. Talbot be- came sure of his particular talent at last, and de- termined to remain in politics for the rest of his life. Moreover, the excitement until the 4th of March was intense, for Southern blood was still hot and bitter, and there were rumors in the air that Grant would be assassinated on the day of 293 The Bell in the Fog his inauguration. He was not, however, and Tal- bot was glad to be in Washington on that mem- orable day.","page_number":278,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 795, \"characters\": 4279}","created_at":"2025-09-02

He stopped in the doorway scrutinising Graham, then rushed forward effusively. \" Yes,\" he cried. \" It is you. And you are not dead ! \" My brother is waiting,\" explained Lincoln. \" He is alone in the wind-vane offices. We feared you had been killed in the theatre. He doubted — and things are 122 THE SLEEPER AWAKES very urgent still in spite of what we are telling them there — or he would have come to you.\" They ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage, crossed a great hall, empty save for two hurrying messengers, and entered a comparatively little room, whose only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc of cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall. There Lincoln left Graham for a space, and he remained alone without understanding the shifting smoky shapes that drove slowly across this disc. His attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly. It was cheering, the frantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd, a roaring exultation. This ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound heard between the opening and shutting of a door. In the outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and a melodious clinking as if a loose chain was running over the teeth oJ a wheel. Then he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle oi unseen garments. \" It is Ostrog 1 \" he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, and then everything was stil again. Presently came voices, footsteps and movement with- out. The footsteps of some one person detached itseL from the other sounds and drew near, firm, evenly measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall, white-haired man, clad in garments of cream-colourec silk, appeared, regarding Graham from under his raised arm. For a moment the white form remained holding the curtain, then dropped it and stood before it. Graham's first impression was of a very broad forehead, very pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an aquiline nose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The folds oi flesh over the drooping of the eyes, the corners of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing, and said the man was old. Graham rose to his feet instinctively, OSTROG 123 and for a moment the two men stood in silence, regarding each other. \" You are Ostrog ? \" said Graham. \" I am Ostrog.\" \" The Boss ? \" \" So I am called.\" Graham felt the inconvenience of the silence. \" I have to thank you chiefly, I understand, for my safety,\" he said presently. \" We were afraid you were killed,\" said Ostrog. \" Or sent to sleep again — for ever. We have been doing everything to keep our secret — the secret of your dis- appearance. Where have you been ? How did you get here ? Graham told him briefly. Ostrog listened in silence. He smiled faintly. \" Do you know what 1 was doing when they came to tell me you had come ? \" \" How can I guess ? \" \" Preparing your double.\" \" My double ? \" \" A man as like you as we could find. We were going to hypnotise him, to save him the difficulty of acting. It was imperative. The whole of this revolt depends on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even now a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring to see you. They do not trust . . . You know, of course — something of your position ? \" \" Very little,\" said Graham. \" It is like this.\" Ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned. \" You are absolute owner,\" he said, \" of the world. You are King of the Earth. Your powers are limited in many intricate ways, but you are the figure-head, the popular symbol of government.","page_number":122,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 794, \"characters\": 4216}","created_at":"2025-09-23 04:16:05.028054+00"},{"id":"00cdefd0-6098-45ba-b8f7-4265f914cec5","book_id":"885857a9-3c23-42aa-8e41-fd9e2cc9fa05","chunk_index":69,"content":"What is a man, If his chief good, and market of his time, Be but to sleep, and feed?

Both were lost forever—his status partly on account of the reasons before mentioned, and partly because Shanley wasn’t particularly interested in Bubble Creek; his brier because it became a part, an integral part, of that memorable wreck, as Shanley, who was peacefully smoking in the front-end compartment of the colonist coach when the trouble happened, left the pipe behind while he catapulted through the open door—it was summer and sizzling hot—and landed, a very much dazed, bewildered, but not otherwise hurt Shanley, halfway up the embankment on the off side of a scene of most amazing disorder. The potentialties that lie in a sprung rail are something to marvel at. Up ahead, the engine had promptly turned turtle, and, as promptly giving vent to its displeasure at the indignity heaped upon it, had incased itself in an angry, hissing cloud of steam; behind, the baggage and mail cars seemed to have vied with each other in affectionate regard for the tender. Only the brass-polished, nickel- plated Pullmans at the rear still held the rails; the rest was just a crazy, slewed- edge-ways, up-canted, toppled-over string of cars, already beginning to smoke as the flames licked into them. The shouts of those who had made their escape, the screams of those still imprisoned within the wreckage, the sight of others crawling through the doors and windows brought Shanley back to his senses. He rose to his feet, blinked furiously, as was his habit on all untoward occasions, and the next instant he was down the embankment and into the game—to begin his career as a railroad man. That’s where he started—in the wreck at Little Dance. In and out of the blazing pyre, after a woman or a child; the crash of his ax through splintering woodwork; the scorching heat; prying away some poor devil wedged down beneath the débris; tinkling glass as the heat cracked the windows or he beat through a pane with his fist—it was all hazy, all a dream to Shanley as, hours afterward, a grim, gaunt figure with blackened, bleeding face, his clothes hanging in ribbons, he rode into the Big Cloud yards on the derrick car. Some men would have hit up the claim agent for a stake; Shanley hit up Carleton for a job. But for modesty’s sake, previous to presenting himself before the superintendent’s desk, he borrowed from one of the wrecking crew the only available article of wearing apparel at hand—a very dirty and disreputable pair of overalls. Dirty and disreputable, but—whole. “I want a job, Mr. Carleton,” said he bluntly, when he had gained admittance to the super. “You do, eh?” replied Carleton, looking him up and down. “You do, eh? You’re a pretty hard-looking nut, h’m?” Shanley blinked, but, being painfully aware that he undoubtedly did look all if not more than that, and being, too, not quite sure what to make of the super, he contented himself with the remark: “I ain’t a picture, I suppose.” “H’m!” said Carleton. “Been up at the wreck, I hear—what?” “Yes,” said Shanley shortly. No long story, no tale of what he’d done, no anything—just “Yes,” and that was what caught Carleton. “What can you do?” demanded the super. “Anything. I’m not fussy,” replied Chanley. “H’m!” said Carleton. “You don’t look it.” And he favored Shanley with another prolonged stare. Shanley, at first uncomfortable, shifted nervously from one foot to the other; then, as the stare continued, he began to get irritated. “Look here,” he flung out suddenly. “I ain’t on exhibition. I come for a job. I ain’t got any letters of recommendation from pastors of churches in the East. I ain’t got anything. My name’s Shanley, an’ I haven’t even got anything to prove that .” “You’ve got your nerve,” said Carleton, leaning back in his swivel chair and tucking a thumb in the armhole of his vest. “Ever worked on a railroad?” “No,” answered Shanley, a little less assertively, as he saw his chances of a job vanishing into thin air, and already regretting his hasty speech—a few odd nickels wasn’t a very big stake for a man starting out in a new country, and that represented the sum total of Shanley’s worldly wealth. “No, I never worked on a railroad.” “H’m,” continued Carleton. “Well, my friend, you can report to the trainmaster in the morning and tell him I said to put you on breaking. Get out!” It came so suddenly and unexpectedly that it took Shanley’s breath.","page_number":60,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 784, \"characters\": 4568}","created_at":"2025-08-19 05:47:39.452473+00"},{"id":"00d769e7-0b47-4f62-a3ec-0e53c112c3d2","book_id":"3a1c01b1-1cfb-4b62-8be0-a785f22b34c8","chunk_index":15,"content":"Remember different whinchers have different powers. The Story of Rags Habakuk, the Two Blue Rats, and the Circus Man Who Came with Spot Cash Money Rags Habakuk was going home. His day’s work was done. The sun was down. Street lamps began shining. Burglars were starting on their night’s work. It was no time for an honest ragman to be knocking on people’s back doors, saying, “Any rags?” or else saying, “Any rags? any bottles? any bones?” or else saying “Any rags? any bottles? any bones? any old iron? any copper, brass, old shoes all run down and no good to anybody to-day? any old clothes, old coats, pants, vests? I take any old clothes you got.” Yes, Rags Habakuk was going home. In the gunnysack bag on his back, humped up on top of the rag humps in the bag, was an old vest. It was the same old vest Jason Squiff threw out of a door at Rags Habakuk. In the pocket of the vest was the gold buckskin whincher with a power in it. Well, Rags Habakuk got home just like always, sat down to supper and smacked his mouth and had a big supper of fish, just like always. Then he went out to a shanty in the back yard and opened up the gunnysack rag bag and fixed things out classified just like every day when he came home he opened the gunnysack bag and fixed things out classified. The last thing of all he fixed out classified was the vest with the gold buckskin whincher in the pocket. “Put it on—it’s a glad rag,” he said, looking at the vest. “It’s a lucky vest.” So he put his right arm in the right armhole and his left arm in the left armhole. And there he was with his arms in the armholes of the old vest all fixed out classified new. Next morning Rags Habakuk kissed his wife g’by and his eighteen year old girl g’by and his nineteen year old girl g’by. He kissed them just like he always kissed them—in a hurry—and as he kissed each one he said, “I will be back soon if not sooner and when I come back I will return.” Yes, up the street went Rags Habakuk. And soon as he left home something happened. Standing on his right shoulder was a blue rat and standing on his left shoulder was a blue rat. The only way he knew they were there was by looking at them. There they were, close to his ears. He could feel the far edge of their whiskers against his ears. “This never happened to me before all the time I been picking rags,” he said. “Two blue rats stand by my ears and never say anything even if they know I am listening to anything they tell me.” So Rags Habakuk walked on two blocks, three blocks, four blocks, squinting with his right eye slanting at the blue rat on his right shoulder and squinting with his left eye slanting at the blue rat on his left shoulder. “If I stood on somebody’s shoulder with my whiskers right up in somebody’s ear I would say something for somebody to listen to,” he muttered. Of course, he did not understand it was the gold buckskin whincher and the power working. Down in the pocket of the vest he had on, the gold buckskin whincher power was saying, “Because you have two K’s in your name you must have two blue rats on your shoulders, one blue rat for your right ear, one blue rat for your left ear.” It was good business. Never before did Rags Habakuk get so much old rags. “Come again—you and your lucky blue rats,” people said to him. They dug into their cellars and garrets and brought him bottles and bones and copper and brass and old shoes and old clothes, coats, pants, vests. Every morning when he went up the street with the two blue rats on his shoulders, blinking their eyes straight ahead and chewing their whiskers so they sometimes tickled the ears of old Rags Habakuk, sometimes women came running out on the front porch to look at him and say, “Well, if he isn’t a queer old mysterious ragman and if those ain’t queer old mysterious blue rats!” All the time the gold buckskin whincher and the power was working. It was saying, “So long as old Rags Habakuk keeps the two blue rats he shall have good luck—but if he ever sells one of the blue rats then one of his daughters shall marry a taxicab driver—and if he ever sells the other blue rat then his other daughter shall marry a moving-picture hero actor.” Then terrible things happened.","page_number":39,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 797, \"characters\": 4207}","created_at":"2025-08-19 14:45:57.10765+00"},{"id":"00dafead-9eb0-4a94-bd78-a37a4b8945c4","book_id":"62c4273b-5c3e-4405-a92a-2372666abcf6","chunk_index":4,"content":"The figure of the ruler asking a question, often a riddle, with disastrous consequences to himself is equally old and dispersed. In his Historia Regum Britanniae (1136) Geoffrey of Mon- mouth converted folklore to history and established Lear and his daughters as rulers of ancient Britain, thus be- queathing them to the chronicles. Raphael Holinshed’s (1587) declared that “‘Leir, the sonne of Baldud,” came to the throne “‘in the yeare of the world 3105, at what time Joas reigned in Juda,” but belief in the historicity of such British kings was now beginning to wane, and Shake- speare could deal freely with the record. He read the story also in John Higgins’ lamentable verses in The Firste part of the Mirour for Magistrates (1574), and in Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, II, 10, 27-32. He knew, and may 15 INTRODUCTION even have acted in, a bland dramatic version, The True Chronicle History of King Leir, published anonymously in 1605 but staged at least as early as 1594. The printing of the old play may mark an effort to capitalize upon the staging of Shakespeare’s, performed at court on December 26, 1606, and probably first brought out at the Globe playhouse sometime in 1605, although its allusion to “these late eclipses of the sun and moon”’ was not necessarily suggested by those of September and Oc- tober of that year. The only certain anterior limit of date is March 16, 1603, when Samuel Harsnett’s Declaration of Egregious Popishe Impostures was registered for publica- tion. That this excursion in “pseudo-demonology”’ was available to Shakespeare is evident in various ways, most clearly in the borrowed inventory of devils imbedded in Edgar’s jargon as Tom o’ Bedlam. It is of small conse- quence to fix the date of King Lear so far as its relation to the older play is concerned, which must be reckoned as analogue rather than source, but if, as seems certain, it was composed in 1605 or early 1606, it belongs to the same season of the poet’s growth as The Tragedy ofMacbeth. In its pre-Shakespearean forms, both those mentioned above and others, the Lear story remains rudimentary. The emphasis may vary in various recensions, depending upon whether the author was most interested in the in- expedience of subdividing a kingdom, the mutability of fortune, or, as in the older play, the rewards of Christian virtue ; but all are alike in that they end happily for Lear, who is reconciled to Cordelia and restored to his throne. The fact that the story was sometimes followed by a sequel in which Cordelia was finally hounded to suicide by the broodlings of her wicked sisters has little bearing on a remarkable fact: Shakespeare alone and in defiance of precedent conducted Lear to ultimate misery. Enter Lear, with Cordelia in his arms. . . . He dies. These directions enclose a scene which demonstrates beyond any other in 16 INTRODUCTION tragic literature the intransigence of poetic art —inventing the inevitable, investing horrifying things with beauty. Compared with the tragedies ofancient Greece—and itis with these alone that one is tempted to compare it — King Lear suggests the Gothic order. Its form is irregular and organic, determined seemingly by a series of upward thrusts of mounting internal energy. There is even a Gothic element of the grotesque, as when mock-beggar, jester, and king, reduced to common condition, hold their mad juridical proceedings in a storm-lashed shelter, or when crazed king and blinded subject exchange lamenta- tions and puns! In the method of Lear’s madness there is often a savage humor, more remarkable when all is said than his companioning with a Fool. It was the Fool, how- ever, who seemed to the next age the unpardonable sin against classical decorum. In the 1680 adaptation by Nahum Tate he was expunged from the play, along with the tragic ending. Tate capped the concluding felicities of the pre-Shakespearean versions by huddling up a mar- riage between Edgar and Cordelia ; yet his work held the stage throughout the eighteenth century. It is always rue- fully remarked that the greatest critic of the age approved the adaptation, but in fairness we should add that it was not for literary reasons. The pain of Shakespeare’s con- cluding scenes was simply too much for Dr Johnson ; his response is preferable to that of those — fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils — who can read these scenes un- moved. The original play, or its approximation, was restored to the stage in the early nineteenth century, after it had begun to receive its critical due from the romantic essayists and poets. It isa poet’s play.","page_number":17,"metadata":"{\"wordCount\": 776, \"characters\": 4605}","created_at":"2025-10-30 04:39:59.319794+00"}]
